   - Chrome and Postman:                                            
     - [https://www.google.com/chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
     - [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop)
	 
2. Get the Source Code
   - Command-line Git:  
     `git clone https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw.git`
   - in Eclipse:  
     Import the projects into your Eclipse workspace:  
     File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace
   
3. Set up npm and bower (One-time step)
   - Install NodeJS:                                                                     
     [https://nodejs.org/en/download/current](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)
   - Open a command prompt in the mdw-hub project directory
    ```
    npm install
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install -g bower
    bower install
   ```
4. Build the Projects
   - Window > Show View > Other > Gradle  > Gradle Tasks
     Select the mdw project and Select Show all Tasks. Expand Other folder in mdw project and double-click the "buildAll" task
   - (On Mac): Run `gradle buildAll` from the command-line instead, followed by refreshing all projects in Eclipse.

5. Use [Embedded DB](/mdw-workflow/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/db/readme.md) or set up an external MySQL database as described in [this readme](/mdw/database/mysql/readme.txt)

6. Edit configuration files to suit local environment:
   - mdw/config/mdw.properties
   - mdw/config/access.yaml
   - mdw/config/seed_users.json
   - (On Linux or Mac): Copy mdw-common/META-INF/mdw/spring/application-context.xml to mdw/config/spring/application-context.xml, and edit so that ActiveMQ dataDirectory points to a writeable location.
7. Deploy on Tomcat in Eclipse
   - Edit mdw/config/mdw.properties to suit your environment.
   - Edit mdw/config/access.yaml to set devUser to yourself.
   - In Eclipse Servers view, right-click and select New > Server  
     **Important**: Select the Apache > Tomcat 8.0 (MDW) runtime
     and make sure you have a jdk 1.8 installed and added it to your class path.
   - Select the mdw-hub module in the Add/Remove wizard page
   - Double-click on the server and set the startup timeout to something large (like 3600s)
   - Under MDW Server Options set the following Java Options (appropriate for your workspace):
 
    ```	
    -Dmdw.runtime.env=dev  
    -Dmdw.config.location=c:/workspaces/mdw/mdw/config  
    -Dmdw.runtime.env=dev
    -Xms512m -Xmx1024m
    ```

8. Run
   - Right-click on the server and select Debug to start it up (this should automatically publish mdw-hub)
   - (On Mac): Right-click on the mdw-hub project in Eclipse and manually add the 'web' folder to the root of the Deployment Assembly: Properties > Deployment Assembly.
   - Check MDWHub access:                                                
     http://localhost:8080/mdw
   
### Code Format
1. Java, Groovy, Javascript and JSON:
     The Eclipse code formatters are version-controlled in .settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs, so as long as you're up-to-date with Git you should automatically have the correct settings. If you want to use them for another project, you can download and import them from these formatter files:   
     - Java/Groovy: https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/docs/MDWCodeFormatter.xml   
     - Javascript/JSON: https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/docs/mdw-javascript-formatter.xml   
     - Please note that we use **spaces instead of tabs** for indenting all source code.
2. XML, HTML and YAML:  
     These have to be configured manually in Eclipse.  For all formats we use **spaces instead of tabs**.
     The following screenshots illustrate how to set these:  
     - XML:                                                    
      ![xml formatter](/docs/_docs/help/images/xmlformat.png)
     - HTML:                                                           
      ![html formatter](docs/_docs/help/images/htmlformat.png)
     - YAML:                                           
      ![yaml formatter](docs/_docs/help/images/yamlformat.png)

### Designer
1. Designer Projects:       
     - com.centurylink.mdw.designer (gradle parent)
     - com.centurylink.mdw.designer.core
     - com.centurylink.mdw.designer.feature
     - com.centurylink.mdw.designer.rcp
     - com.centurylink.mdw.designer.ui

2. Build and Run:
   - Build Designer
     - These projects use the MDW 5.5 versions of mdw-common as mdw-schemas as dependencies, so to build you need these MDW 5.5 projects locally or to have their jars available through a repository.
     - Assuming you've got the MDW 5.5 source code locally, in com.centurylink.mdw.designer/gradle.properties, set mdwVersion and mdwOutputDir to point to this location.
     - (One time) Run an MDW 5.5 build in its workspace and then in com.centurylink.mdw.designer.core, run the gradle task getMdwCommon to copy in the 5.5 dependencies.
     - (Subsequently) When changes are made to common code in MDW 5.5 and an Eclipse build is performed in that workspace, running devGetMdwCommon will incrementally copy these.
     - Now an Eclipse build of the Designer projects should show no errors.
   - Debug Designer
     - To run through Eclipse, right-click on project com.centurylink.mdw.designer.ui and select Debug As > Eclipse Application.

### Documentation
1. Source
   - Documentation is in the /docs directory of the master branch on GitHub
   - Optionally you can import the /docs project into your Eclipse workspace for editing these artifacts.
2. Local GitHub Pages
   - To test doc access before pushing, and to make changes to default layouts and styles, you can build through [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/) locally.
   - Install Ruby 2.1.0 or higher and add its bin directory to your PATH.
   - Install Bundler:
     ```
	 gem install bundler
	 ```
   - Download the CURL CA Certs from http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem and save in your Ruby installation directory.
   - Set environment variable SSL_CERT_FILE to point to this this cacert.pem file location.
   - Install Ruby DevKit: https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit
   - Install Jekyll and all its dependencies (in the /docs directory):
     ```
	 bundle install
	 ```
   - Build GitHub pages site locally (in the /docs directory):
     ```
	 bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --baseurl ''
	 ```
   - Access locally in your browser:
     http://127.0.0.1:4000/
