		<h1 id="Task_Editor">Task Editor</h1>
		<p>The task editor allows you to view and edit the tasks in your task list. Double-click on a task in your task list to open the editor. The features of the task editor will vary depending on whether it is a local task or a shared repository task. For shared repository tasks, there are some differences depending on the type of repository (and corresponding connector) that you are using (link: connectors). </p>
		<h2 id="Repository_Task_Details">Repository Task Details</h2>
		<p>In this section, we describe the task editor for shared bugs in a Bugzilla repository. Task editors for other repository types such as JIRA offer similar functionality.</p>
		<p>

				<b>Synchronize Incoming Changes</b> - Updates the local copy of the task to reflect any changes on the server.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Create a new subtask</b> - Creates a new task that will be considered a prerequisite to completing the current task. Subtasks appear nested under their parent task in the task list. In Bugzilla terminology, the subtask "Blocks" the parent task and the subtask's ID will appear in the "Blocks:" field of the parent task.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>History</b> - Displays the task's change history in an internal browser using the web interface.
			</li>
			<li>

			<b>Team Planning</b>
			The Team Planning section contains time-related information about the task that will be shared with your team. You can use the 
			<b>Due</b> field to set a due date for your task. On the due date, the task will appear in red in your task list.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Attachments</b>
			You can attach a file to this task so that a copy will be uploaded to your task repository and become available to anyone who can access the task. 
		</p>
		<p>To attach a file</p>
		<ul>
			<li>click the "Attach..." button, which will open a wizard.</li>
			<li>Select from one of the following:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>File</b> - Uploads a file from your system. Click "Browse" on the right to select the file.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Clipboard</b> - 
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Workspace</b> - Uploads a file from your workspace. Select the file from the box below.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Click next to enter attachment details:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Description</b> - Provide a brief description of the file. This description will appear in the attachment list in the task editor.
					</li>

					<li>
						<b>Content Type</b> - Optionally specify a content type for the file
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Patch</b> - Check this if the attachment is a source code patch file
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Attach Context</b> - Check this if you would also like to attach the context of your task. This context describes the resources that are most relevant to the task. If you attach a context, others can download it and focus the UI on the same resources that are relevant to you.
					</li>
					<li>Click "Next" to preview your file. If your file is an image, a preview of the file will appear.</li>
					<li>Click "Finish" to upload the file to the task repository. Files are uploaded without the need to click "submit" at the bottom of the task editor.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>Duplicate Detection</b>
			When submitting bug reports, you can avoid duplicates by clicking the "Search" button. This will search the repository for a stack trace that matches a stack trace in the task's Description field. The results of the duplicate detection show up in the Search view. If a match is found, you can open it and comment instead of creating a new bug report.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Comments</b>
			Use this section to add new comments about the task and view all previous comments. Comments you have read previously are folded. You can expand and re-read individual comments or click the "+" at the top right to expand all comments.
