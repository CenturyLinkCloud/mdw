####  Roles and Permissions
- Before you can create or change processes in MDW Designer, you'll need to be added to Users, Workgroups and Roles for your environment.  An administrator can grant you 
  this role using the MDWHub on Admin page.  You can use the Admin tab to navigate to Users, Workgroups and Roles links from the left navigation pane and follow the instructions
  on each page. 
  
- Click the New button to open the New User page:

  ![alt text](../images/addUser.png "addUser")
  
- Once the required fields (.*) have been filled out, click Save button to save the change.

- Next, click Workgroups link and click New button to open the New Workgroup page. Enter your name and select the name of the group you are adding from the Parent drop down list box.  
  You may need to repeat this step to add yourself to each group listed in the drop down list box.

- The Admin tab is available to users who have the Administrators role.  The table below summarizes the MDW built-in roles and their permissions.
