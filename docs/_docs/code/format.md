### Code Format

1. Java, Kotlin, Groovy, JavaScript and JSON:
     The IntelliJ formatters are version-controlled,
     so as long as you're up-to-date with Git you should automatically have the correct settings. 
     - Please note that we use **spaces instead of tabs** for indenting all source code.  Java, Kotlin and Groovy
       are indented four spaces, whereas JavaScript, JSON, HTML and XML are indented two spaces.
2. **Action Required**: XML, HTML, CSS and YAML:
     These have to be configured manually in IntelliJ.  For all formats we use **spaces instead of tabs**.
3. As of MDW 6.1 the no-tabs rule is enforced by the build.
