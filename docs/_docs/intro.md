MDW stands for Model Driven Workflow.  It's a cloud-enabled, Java-based framework with the aim of delivering workflow benefits 
to all types of applications.  MDW specializes in microservice orchestration.  It comes with all the tools to model your app flow, 
and to visually make sense of your microservices.  Under the hood is a robust, scalable, extensible runtime engine.
MDW also comes with a toolkit for monitoring and analysis to facilitate continuous improvement.

representation that can be understood and owned by the rightful domain experts. Here's what this looks like for a simple bug-handling 
workflow in the [mdw-demo](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo) example project:
