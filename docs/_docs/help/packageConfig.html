<h1>Workflow Package Configuration</h1>
When deploying in a cloud environment the mechanism for setting your app-specific workflow properties is through MDW Package Configuration.
This enables you to configure custom settings that apply only to your particular workflow application.
<br/><br/>
Also, the MDW runtime provides many injection points where you can configure behavior provided by your custom deployable artifact (Jar File).
Examples of this include <a href="dynamicJavaActivity.html"> Dynamic Java</a>, <a href="MDWCamelIntegration.html">Camel Integration</a>, and <a href="assets.html">MDW Assets</a>.  
Frequently you'll want to associate your workflow package with a corresponding deployable artifact so that MDW knows where to locate your custom code.
This is accomplished using Package Configuration as well.
