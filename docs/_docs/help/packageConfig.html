<h1>Workflow Package Configuration</h1>
When deploying in a cloud environment the mechanism for setting your app-specific workflow properties is through MDW Package Configuration.
This enables you to configure custom settings that apply only to your particular workflow application.
<br/><br/>
Also, the MDW runtime provides many injection points where you can configure behavior provided by your custom deployable artifact (Jar File).
Examples of this include <a href="dynamicJavaActivity.html"> Dynamic Java</a>, <a href="MDWCamelIntegration.html">Camel Integration</a>, and <a href="assets.html">MDW Assets</a>.  
Frequently you'll want to associate your workflow package with a corresponding deployable artifact so that MDW knows where to locate your custom code.
This is accomplished using Package Configuration as well.

<h3>Maintaining Package Configuration</h3>
To access workflow package configuration in Designer, right-click on a package in Process Explorer view and select Show Properties.
Then select the Configuration tab in Properties View.  

The screenshot below illustrates a workflow package that already contains some configuration settings.

<br/><br/>
Package settings are configured per-environment (even for those such as in the illustration which are not environment-dependent).
To add a new property value, click the Add button under properties.  
<p>To add another environment, click the Add button under Environments.

The environment name must correspond to the runtimeEnv Java system property that MDW uses to identify which type of environment you're running in.
The runtimeEnv can be any value, but two values have special meaning: dev and prod (both lower case).  Dev environments allow convenience features such as unauthenticated access.
Prod environments require special permissions and confirmations before performing certain actions, and disallow other actions completely.
<br/><br/>
The package configuration settings are exported along with the processes and assets for a package, and so they carry forward when migrated to a new environment.
<br/><br/>
You can leverage your package configuration properties using the <i>props</i> <a href="bindingExpressions.html">binding expression</a> syntax in your activity design attributes, 
and programmatically through the <a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/config/PropertyManager.html">MDW PropertyManager API</a>.
This gives you a mechanism for plugging in environment-specific values.
