<h1>Using Activity Implementor ProcessFinishActivity</h1>

This activity is the standard process finish activity.
<p>
The activity is used to choose the status of the process
instance after completion, and a completion code returned
as calling activity.
<p>
The following table shows the options of the attribute "Action on Termination":
<table border='1'>
<tr><th>Option</th><th>Internal Completion Code</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Complete Process</td><td>FINISH:<i>completion-code</i></td><td>
        <ul><li>The process
		instance will be set to completed status. All pending event wait instances
		associated with the activity instances of the process instance will be cancelled.
		All pending manual task instances owned by the process instance and its embedded
		subprocess instances will be cancelled.</li>
		<li>If the process instance is created by a single process invocation activity
		in a parent process, it will complete
        and transition according to completion code when the invocation
        is synchronous, and it does nothing when it is asynchronous.</li>
        <li>If the process instance is created by a multiple process invocation activity
        in a parent process, it simply
        informs that activity this child process is finished, and the completion
        code is ignored.</li>
        <li>If the process is invoked remotely by another MDW application, it will inform
        	the remote process invocation activity in that application</li>
        </ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Cancel Process</td><td>ABORT:process</i></td><td>
		<ul><li>The process instance and all descendant
		process instances that are not yet completed will be cancelled. Any event wait
		instances and task instances associated with these process instances will be cancelled
	    as well.</li>
	    <li>If the process instance is created by a single process invocation activity
		in a parent process, it will be <em>cancelled</em>
        and transition out using null completion code when the invocation
        is synchronous, and it does nothing when it is asynchronous.</li>
        <li>If the process instance is created by a multiple process invocation activity
        in a parent process, it simply
        informs that activity this child process is finished, and the completion
        code is ignored.</li>
        <li>If the process is invoked remotely by another MDW application, it will inform
        	the remote process invocation activity in that application</li>
        </ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Default behavior</td><td>null or set by other activities</td><td>
		the behavior is set by the last API call to <code>setProcessInstanceCompletionCode()</code>
		in an activity already executed by the process. The API call should set the completion
		code listed in the previous entries. If no API call to the method is made in any
		of the activities, the completion code is null, which is equivalent to <code>FINISH</code>.
		Note that manual tasks in exception embedded subprocess invokes the method
		implicitly, which will be addressed later.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
If the activity is in an embedded sub process, the behavior are somewhat different.
For error, correction and delay embedded sub processes, the following table explain the behavior:
<table border='1'>
<tr><th>Option</th><th>Internal Completion Code</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Complete Process</td><td>FINISH:<i>completion-code</i></td>
		<td><ul><li>The (embedded) process instance will complete. All pending
				event wait instances will be cancelled, so are all pending manual tasks</li>
		  <li>The calling activity, <em>which is not a type for invoking subprocesses</em> will 
          complete and transition according to completion code.
	 	  </li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Cancel Process</td><td>ABORT:process</td><td>
		<ul><li>The (embedded) process instance will complete. All pending
				event wait instances will be cancelled, so are all pending manual tasks</li>
	    <li>The calling activity instance in the main (parent) process will be cancelled.</li>
		<li>The <em>parent</em> process instance will be cancelled
		along with all its descendant processes that are not yet completed,
 		<em>which is not a process invocation activity. The current (embedded) process
 		instance is put in completed status.</em> The event wait and task instances associated
 		with all those process instances will be cancelled.</li>
 		<li>If the parent process is created by a process invocation activity in a grand-parent
 		   process, or created by a remote process invocation activity in another MDW application,
 		   the behavior of the caller is the same as if the parent process is cancelled
 		   in its Finish activity, described above.
 		</li>
 		</td></tr>
<tr><td>Default behavior</td><td>null or set by other activities</td><td>
		the behavior is set by the last API call to <code>setProcessInstanceCompletionCode()</code>
		in an activity already executed by the process. The API call should set the completion
		code listed in the previous entries. If no API call to the method is made in any
		of the activities, the completion code is null, which is equivalent to FINISH.
		Note that manual tasks in exception embedded subprocess invokes the method
		implicitly, which will be addressed later.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
For abort embedded sub processes, the behavior is hard-wired to "Cancel Process"
described above, and there is no option to change that.

<p>
For error embedded sub processes (exception handlers), any manual task in the processes 
invokes <code>setProcessInstanceCompletionCode()</code> implicitly, based on the task actions
the users selected.
The following table shows the completion codes corresponding to task actions:
<table border='1'>
<tr><th>Task action</th><th>Process completion code</th><th>Special Note</th></tr>
<tr><td>Complete</td><td>FINISH</td><td>nothing special</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cancel</td><td>ABORT</td><td>This is not used by regular finish activity. 
		It will make the calling activity as cancelled, but does not cancel the parent
		process instance. The current (embedded) process instance is put in completed status.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Abort</td><td>ABORT:process</td><td>nothing special</td></tr>
<tr><td>Retry</td><td>START</td><td>This is not used by regular finish activity. 
		It will make the calling activity as cancelled, but will retry (restart) the
		same activity again. The current (embedded) process instance is put in completed status</td></tr>
<tr><td>custom action</td><td>FINISH:<i>custom_action</i></td><td>nothing special</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The attribute "Do Not Notify Caller" is used to stop notifying caller (internal event process finish)
when it is set.
