<h1>Listeners and External Event Handlers</h1>
Listeners are used to receive asynchronous messages from
external systems. Because the protocols can vary, and
the message formats are typically different, the framework
handles them using the following methodology:
<ul>
	<li>Listeners are defined in protocol specific ways.
		Listeners typically do minimal things and delegate
		real processing to external event handlers (these event handlers will handle requests that are coming from other systems/apps in the workflow) so that
		the messages can be handled in non-protocol specific ways.
		MDW provides listeners for many common built-in protocols, and the hope
		is that MDW applications will rarely need to define their own listeners.
		One of the most importing thing the listeners do
		is to determine, typically based on the contents
		of the messages (especially by the root elements
		of the XML messages), an external event handler
		to handle the message. It does this by examining
		the external event handlers configured in the Designer
		and saved as assets with .evth as an extension.
		The listeners then delegate the processing of
		the message to the external event handlers.
		</li>
	<li>An external event handler should interpret
		the external message and it may perform one of the
		following main functions:
		<ul>
			<li>Start a process instance</li>
			<li>Send a message to a waiting process instance (solicited or unsolicited such as
				cancel and pending order changes)</li>
			<li>Invoke a synchronous process and return its response</li>
			<li>Respond directly with all custom code and no touch to processes.</li>
		</ul>
		The handlers may perform the following common tasks along with the main functions:
		<ul>
		    <li>Create acknowledgment messages</li>
		    <li>Validate input data and create error messages</li>
		    <li>Set input parameters and master request IDs when starting a process</li>
		    <li>Save large chunk of data as documents</li>
		</ul>
		MDW provides two built-in external event handlers, one for starting processes
		(<code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.ProcessStartEventHandler</code>) as well
		as invoking processes as services,
		and the other for sending messages to existing process instances
		(<code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.<code>NotifyWaitingActivityEventHandler</code></code>).
	</li>
</ul>
Although built-in listeners are often sufficient for most applications,
it is often necessary for an application to provide their own external event handlers 
for performing customization not achievable through the built-in listeners.
The external event handlers (including the built-in ones)
must be configured through the Designer so that
the listeners know which one to use for an incoming message.

<h2><a id="externalEventHandlers">Configuring External Event Handlers</h2>
External event handlers are configured through the Designer and
they are saved as assets with <em>.evth as an extension.
Each entry contains an event pattern and an event handler specification.</em>
<p>
The event pattern is described using a variant of the XPath language that is name-space
agnostic. See <a href="xpath.html">this link</a> for MDW XPath language
examples and syntax.
<p>
The handler specification is typically a fully qualified class name. It may also
take additional parameters which resembles URL parameter syntax, as in
<pre>
	com.centurylink.mdw.listener.ProcessStartEventHandler?ProcessName=MyProcess
</pre>
If there is more than one parameter, they are delimited by "&amp;".
<p>
Since the standard process start event handler may be used very often, there is a syntax abbreviation
supported, where you can use "START_PROCESS" in place of the class name, so the following specification
is equivalent to the one above:
<pre>
    START_PROCESS?ProcessName=MyProcess&MasterRequestID={//Order/OrderNumber}
</pre>
Similarly, there is a syntax abbreviation for the built-in event hander
<code>NotifyWaitingActivityEventHandler</code>, which is <code>NOTIFY_PROCESS</code>.
An example of its usage is (description of its syntax will be described later):
<pre>
    NOTIFY_PROCESS?EventName=ServiceOrder{//OrderType}{//OrderNumber}
</pre>
</br>
<h3>Use Camel Routes as an alternative to MDW event handler registration</h3>
As an alternative to the traditional MDW External Event Handler registration described above,
 you may choose to expose your service through a Camel route.<br>
The advantages of this include the advanced transport and filtering capabilities that Camel supports.</br>
For example, Camel goes beyond the basic XPath message filtering provided by MDW event handlers to enable filtering according to request header values or even by complex scripting language expressions.
See <a href="MDWCamelIntegration.html">Camel Routes</a> documentation for details.

<h2>Built-In Listeners</h2>
MDW includes a number of prebuilt, extensible options for hosting Web services.
See the <a href="http://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/help/">Web Services</a> documentation for details.
 
<h3>Document (SOAP) Web Service Listener</h3>
To expose document-literal style services using a custom WSDL definition, MDW provides a mechanism whereby the WSDL document is created as an <a href="assets.html">asset</a>.
An HTTP GET request against a custom WSDL asset called Employee looks like:<br/>http://localhost:8080/mdw/services/SOAP/Employee.wsdl<br/><br/>
A similar URL can be used as the endpoint for an HTTP POST request which will invoke the service.
In this case the request is unwrapped from the SOAP envelope, and based on the top-level element the usual message pattern matching procedure is followed.
Likewise, the response content is presumed to be XML and is inserted into a SOAP envelope.
<br/><br/>
The endpoint location in the WSDL asset can be parameterized as follows based on environment-specific property settings:<br/>
 &lt;soap:address location="${mdw.services.url}/SOAP/Employee.wsdl" /&gt; 
 
<p>
The listener class is <a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/hub/servlet/SoapServlet.html">   
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.hub.servlet.SoapServlet</code></a>.
<p>
The following meta information values are populated:
<ul>
  <li>Protocol. This is always "SOAP"</li>
  <li>RequestURL. The endpoint URL for the request</li>
  <li>EventName. Event pattern</li>
  <li>EventID. The ID of the external event handler specification</li>
  <li>DocumentID. The ID of the entry in DOCUMENT table storing the request</li>
  <li>&lt;Headers&gt;. The name/value pairs corresponding to all the HTTP and SOAP request headers</li>
</ul>

<h3>RESTful Web Service Listener</h3>
The REST-based Web Service Listener is a simple HTTP servlet that receives and responds to XML or JSON GET or POST requests.
The URL for accessing the servlet is http://host:port#/mdw/Services/packageName/path. Here is an example: http://localhost:8080/mdw/Services/MyServices/Order.

<p>
The listener class is <a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/hub/servlet/RestServlet.html">   
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.hub.servlet.RestServlet</code></a>.. 
<p>
MDW also provides a helper class, <code>com.centurylink.mdw.util.HttpHelper</code>,
that can be used to simplify the client coding. The following sample code
demonstrates the client side code:
<pre>
    String message = "&lt;ping&gt;an XML document&lt;/ping&gt;";
    String httpServletUrl = "http://localhost:8080/mdw/services";
    HttpHelper httpHelper = new HttpHelper(new URL(httpServletUrl));
    String response = httpHelper.post(message);
</pre>
<p>
The following meta information is populated:
<ul>
  <li>Protocol. This is always "RestfulWebService"</li>
  <li>ServiceClass. This is always "com.centurylink.mdw.hub.servlet.RestServlet."</li>
  <li>HttpMethod. This is either "GET" or "POST", and can be in lower or mixed cases.</li>
  <li>Operation. This is the first segment of additional path info, or null if
      there is no additional path info.</li>
  <li>&lt;Parameters&gt;. The name/value pairs corresponding to all the HTTP request parameters</li>      
  <li>&lt;Headers&gt;. The name/value pairs corresponding to all the HTTP request headers</li>      
</ul>
<h3>JMS Listener</h3>
The listener class is <code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.jms.JmsListener</code>
and the queue it is listening is <code>com.centurylink.mdw.external.event.queue</code>.
The following meta information is populated:
<ul>
	<li>Protocol. This is always "Jms"</li>
	<li>RequestID. This is the JMS message ID</li>
	<li>CorrelationID</li>
	<li>ReplyTo</li>
	<li>EventName. Event pattern</li>
	<li>EventID. The ID of the external event handler specification</li>
	<li>DocumentID. The ID of the entry in DOCUMENT table storing the request</li>
</ul>

<h2>Built-In Event Handlers</h2>

<h3>Built-In Process Start Event Handler</h3>
The event handler,
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/listener/ProcessStartEventHandler.html">
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.ProcessStartEventHandler</code></a>,
can be used to start an asynchronous (regular) process or
invoke a synchronous (service) process as service.

When the process to be started is a regular process (see <a href="process.html">
this link</a> for introduction on regular vs. service processes),
it performs the following things:
<ul>
	<li>It finds the most recent version of the process definition
		for the process name specified as the parameter <code>ProcessName</code>
		in the external event handler specification (see below)</li>
	<li>If the parameter <code>MasterRequestID</code> is specified,
		use it as the master request ID (after replacing place holders with
		actual values). Otherwise use external event instance ID 
		as the master request ID.</li>
	<li>It populates and sends a process start message
		to the process controller queue. The master request ID
		is determined as above, and event parameters are set to null.
		</li>
	<li>It creates a standard MDWStatusMessage as the response.
		This may not be a desired feature, so you may
		need to subclass this handler by overriding the method
		createResponseMessage().</li>
</ul>
When the process to be started is a service process (synchronous), instead of
creating the process through JMS messages and creating a standard acknowledgment
as response, it invokes the the process directly and return the value
of the variable "response" of the process as the response.
We note that service processes are invoked as a single transaction and without
using JMS messages.
<p>
The configuration of the event handler
in the designer has a syntax abbreviation of <code>START_PROCESS</code>,
and requires one argument, <code>ProcessName</code>.
The following are some examples:
<pre>
    START_PROCESS?ProcessName=MyProcess
    START_PROCESS?ProcessName=MyProcess&MasterRequestID=Order_{//OrderType}{//OrderNumber}
</pre>
<p>
The specification of Master Request ID allows <em>place holders</em> for
dynamic contents.
<p>
Syntactically, a place holder is an expression enclosed by by braces ("{" and "}").
Currently we allow either a meta parameter name preceded by a "$" (e.g <code>{$CorrelationID}</code>),
or an <a href="xpath.html">MDW XPath expression</a> (e.g. <code>{//OrderNumber}</code>).
In the former case, the place holder will be replaced by the 
meta parameter value passed down from the listeners.
In the latter case, the place holder will be replaced by
the value of applying the XPath expression to the external message.
<p>
Specification of the Master Request ID is not required. When it is not specified,
the external event instance ID will be used as the master request ID for the process
instance.
<p>
This built-in handler does not pass in any parameters
to the process instance. If some variables need to be initialized
from the external message, you can do so by configuring
the start activity of the process.
Configuration of the start activity is described with
<a href="ProcessStartActivity.html">this link</a>.


<h3>Built-In Event Handler for Notifying Waiting Process Instances</h3>
The built-in event handler
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/listener/NotifyWaitingActivityEventHandler.html"> 
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.NotifyWaitingActivityEventHandler</code></a> can be used
to process messages that need to be delivered to existing process instances.
<p>
A process instance that is interested in waiting for external messages
typically executes an <a href="EventWaitActivity.html">event wait activity</a> and must
specify an event name, identifying the messages it waits for.
The event handlers should take care of the tasks of mapping external messages
to event names and inform the process instances waiting for them.
<p>
The built-in handler can be configured through the designer as to how to
map XML messages to event names, with the help of XPath expressions.
Its configuration in the designer has a syntax abbreviation of <code>NOTIFY_PROCESS</code>,
and requires one argument, <code>EventName</code>.
Besides static text, the values of event names may contain 
place holders that will be replaced by dynamic contents.
The syntax and semantics of place holders are the same as for
MasterRequestID described above.
<p>
The following are some examples:
<pre>
    NOTIFY_PROCESS?EventName=MyProcess{$CorrelationID}
    NOTIFY_PROCESS?EventName=ServiceOrder{//OrderType}{//OrderNumber}
</pre>
The event handling mechanism of MDW also takes care of the situation when
the messages arrive prior to the execution of event waiting activities.

<h2>Developing External Event Handler</h2>
External event handlers typically perform one of the followings:
<ul>
	<li>Start a process instance</li>
	<li>Inform process instances that are waiting for messages</li>
	<li>Invoke a service (synchronous) process and return the value
		of its variable "response" as response</li>
</ul>
The built-in process start event handler is a good example for
starting a process, and it is oftentimes sufficient that you use that directly
or subclass it.
<p>
Similarly, for informing existing process instances, it is oftentimes
sufficient that configure or subclass the built-in handler
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/listener/NotifyWaitingActivityEventHandler.html">
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.NotifyWaitingActivityEventHandler</code></a>.
<p>

One common need for customization of starting process handler is to pass parameters (variable
bindings) to the process. This can be achieved by subclassing <code>ProcessStartEventHandler</code>
and override the method <code>buildParameters</code>.  
If the external message contains large data such as service orders, it is recommended 
that you create documents in this method and pass only the document references
to the processes. The method <code>createDocument</code> defined in the base class
can be used to create documents. See Java doc for <a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/listener/ExternalEventHandlerBase.html">
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.ExternalEventHandlerBase</code></a>, which is the super class
for <code>ProcessStartEventHandler</code>, for more details.
<p>
In case you need to define your own event handlers for starting or informing
processes, the best approach is probably to extend the class 
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/listener/ExternalEventHandlerBase.html">
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.ExternalEventHandlerBase</code></a>
instead of implementing <code>com.centurylink.mdw.event.ExternalEventHandler</code>
from scratch. This base class contains methods to start a process, to inform (wake)
process instances, to create a generic response message, to create a document, and so on,
to help implementing a handler.  Please follow the hyper links above for the Javadoc.
<p>
When informing waiting process instances using <code>ExternalEventHandlerBase.notifyProcesses()</code>,
the event manager behind the scene will record the event, check if there is
any process instances waiting for it, and resume them.
<p>
To invoke a service process and return a response synchronously,
the method to use is <code>invokeServiceProcess()</code>.


<h2>Create Listeners</h2>
As we explained above, MDW Framework has provided several built-in listeners
(Web Service, JMS, etc) and those are sufficient for most purposes,
so you should not have
a lot of reasons to create your own listeners. There are reasons, however,
the default listeners are not sufficient, including:
<ul>
  <li>You need a protocol for which there is no built-in listeners for your specific needs.
  	We will add more built-in listeners in the future, if they are commonly needed.</li>
  <li>You need to implement a different Web Service server from
    the default MDW Web Service, probably
  	demanded by a vendor application such as ASMS.</li>
  <li>You would like to create a separate thread pool for load 
  	consideration.</li>
</ul>
The framework provides a class, 
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/listener/ListenerHelper.html">
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.ListenerHelper</code></a>,
that extracts common code needed for implementing listeners.
The most important function the helper can do is to
determine an external event handler to handle an external message.
It does this by examining
the external event handlers configured in the Designer
and saves them as assets with .evth as an extension.
The listener helper then delegates the processing of
the message to the external event handler.
<p>
With this listener helper class, the implementation code for a listener is very minimal.

<h3>Listener Class</h3>
A listener class is the one directly receives the messages
from external systems. It is therefore protocol specific.
<p>
We describe here general requirement for writing listener classes,
and the following subsections describe specific topic for each
protocol.
<p>
Typically a listener class does very little by itself
and delegates the processing of external messages to 
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/listener/ListenerHelper.html">
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.ListenerHelper</code></a>,
which processes
the messages in a non-protocol specific way.
The following code is extracted from the built-in external event listener
class, <code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.jms.ExternalEventListener</code>,
which is a good example for any other listener class delegating the work to ListenerHelper class.
<pre>
   ...
   ListenerHelper helper = new ListenerHelper();
   Map<String, String> metaInfo = new HashMap<String, String>();
   metaInfo.put(Listener.METAINFO_PROTOCOL, Listener.METAINFO_PROTOCOL_JMS);
   metaInfo.put(Listener.METAINFO_REQUEST_PATH, getQueueName());
   metaInfo.put(Listener.METAINFO_SERVICE_CLASS, this.getClass().getName());
   metaInfo.put(Listener.METAINFO_REQUEST_ID, message.getJMSMessageID());
   metaInfo.put(Listener.METAINFO_CORRELATION_ID, message.getJMSCorrelationID());
   if (message.getJMSReplyTo() != null)
       metaInfo.put("ReplyTo", message.getJMSReplyTo().toString());
   resp = helper.processEvent(txt, metaInfo);
   ...
</pre>
The center of the code is to invoke <code>processEvent</code>
method of ListenerHelper class. The listener itself only performs the
following tasks:
<ul>
  <li>Populate meta information</li>
  <li>Extract message contents</li>
  <li>Invoke ListenerHelper.processEvent with the message content
  		and the meta info</li>
  <li>If the protocol requires a response message,
  		construct and send the message from the return message
  		of ListenerHelper.processEvent.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The processEvent method in ListenerHelper performs the following
things:
<ul>
	<li>Parse the message into a DOM document</li>
	<li>Find an external event handler that handles the message,
		using external event handlers configured in the designer.</li>
	<li>Record the request data in DOCUMENT table. Note
	    that if the last step fails to find an handler, an exception
	    will be thrown and this step is by-passed, so the event
	    will <em>not</em> be recorded in the table. The reason we perform
	    this step after finding the handler is because the event
	    name is a foreign key and we must find it.</li>
	<li>Invoke the external event handler and return its return
		message.</li>
</ul>
The method captures all exceptions and if it does capture one,
it will return a default response message MDWStatusMessage.
Since the external systems may not be designed to recognize MDWStatusMessage,
it is therefore desired that the external event handlers
capture all exceptions and generate appropriate response messages.
