<h1>Document Web Service Adapter Activity</h1>

The MDW Document Web Service Adapter Activity provides the ability to invoke document-literal style SOAP services using an arbitrary WSDL definition.
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Design Attributes</h3>
The basic design parameters for configuring a Document Web Service Adapter are illustrated in the screenshot below.
<br/><br/>
The first attribute to specify is the WSDL or endpoint URL for your service request.
The contents of the request document variable are wrapped within a SOAP envelope and HTTP POSTed to this URL.
Then the response is unwrapped from its SOAP envelope, and the top-element contents are saved in the response variable.  
<br/><br/>
The Timeout settings are optional.
To populate or read the SOAP or HTTP header values, extend the base class and implement the appropriate methods.
<br/><br/>
The Document Web Service Adapter supports "Http Basic Authentication" for any targeted web services that require a user/password. The user can enter a user/password combination which will be encoded as per the Basic Authentication guidelines, and sent with each request.
