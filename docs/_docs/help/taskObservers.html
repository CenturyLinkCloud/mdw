<h1>Task Observers</h1>

Task observers can register to be notified when a stage in the task instance lifecycle is reached.
You register a task instance observer by adding its fully-qualified class name on the Observers tab of the Manual Task Activity properties.
Your observer class must implement the TaskInstanceObserver interface or extend TaskActionReporter, which provides default no-op implementations for the interface methods.

<h3>Lifecycle Outcomes</h3>
An observer may be notified when the following lifecycle transitions occur for a task instance.
See the documentation topic <a href="taskAction.html">Task Actions</a> for an explanation of the actions which may trigger these transitions.
<br/><br/>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Open</th>
    <td>Task instance is newly-created or becomes unassigned</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Assigned</th>
    <td>Task instance has been claimed or assigned to someone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Failed</th>
    <td>Task instance has been failed due to a user performing the Abort action</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Completed</th>
    <td>Task instance has been completed by a user performing the Complete action or a custom action</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cancelled</th>
    <td>Task instance has been cancelled by a user</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>In Progress</th>
    <td>Task instance has been flagged as being worked by a user</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Alert</th>
    <td>Task instance is approaching its scheduled Due Date without having been completed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Jeopardy</th>
    <td>Task instance has passed its scheduled Due Date without having been completed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Hold</th>
    <td>Task instance has been placed on hold</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br/><br/>
Your registered observer receives the task instance ID as a parameter, and may use this value to retrieve data related to the task instance, such as the task name.
<br/><br/>
A very common use of task observers has been to send e-mail notices when a task lifecycle outcome has been reached.
With MDW 4.2 the ability to send templated notifications is built in to the framework (see <a href="taskNotices.html">Task Notices</a>).
