<h1>Kafka Adapter Activities</h1>

<p>The class <code>
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/adapter/tibco/PoolableTibcoBusAdapter.html">
com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.adapter.tibco.PoolableTibcoBusAdapter</a></code>
implements an adapter activity that can be used to send a request-reply type
of Tibco BUS message.
The adapter is intended for asynchronous messages as well, but this has
not been implemented yet.

The new implementor uses the poolable adapter mechanism (see <a href='AdapterActivityBase.html'>
Using Adapter Activities</a> for its introduction), which allows
the adapter to be used with a connection pool, and also allows to configure
automatic retries with the activity. The new implementor also allows to configure
bus URL as an attribute, rather than using the <code>busConnector.xml</code>,
which is no longer needed. </p>

<p><em>Important note</em>: with the new implementor, you should not use
the retry loop (a link to itself with the label <code>ERROR:RETRY</code>) 
for the old implementor.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>
The following attributes are used by both implementors, new and old:

<ul>
  <li>Request Variable. This is a variable name. The request message sent to external
      system is taken from the value of this variable.</li>
  <li>Response Variable. This is also a variable name, and the response message
      received from the external system will be bound to the variable.</li>
  <li>Log req/resp. This is a Boolean flag to turn on or off logging of messages
  	  to and from the external systems. The messages are logged in the database table
  	  DOCUMENT for MDW 5.* and ADAPTER_INSTANCE for MDW 4.*.</li>
  <li>Bus Topic. This attribute specifies topic to which the message is published.
	  More than likely, the value is
      deployment specific (different between development, testing and production environment).
      So it is typically specified using MDW <a href="bindingExpressions.html">binding expression</a> syntax 
      <code>#{props['my.bus.topic']}</code>.</li>
  <li>Response Timeout. This is the time out value, in seconds, for waiting for responses.</li>
  <li>Override Inbox. This is used to pass the BUS policy option <code>OverrideInbox</code>.</li>
  <li>Request XSD. This is for documentation purpose only. If a valid URL is specified,
      you can open the request XSD directly from the designer by clicking the "Open Link" button 
      on the right side of the attribute specification.</li>
  <li>Response XSD. This is for documentation purpose only. If a valid URL is specified,
      you can open the response XSD directly from the designer by clicking the "Open Link" button 
      on the right side of the attribute specification.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following additional attributes are supported by the new implementor only:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bus URL: RVD URL, e.g. <code>rvd://239.75.2.3:7523/denvzd.qwest.net:7523</code>.
  		For the old implementor, this information must be specified in a bus connector
  		configuration file (typically named <code>busConnector.xml</code>). The file
  		is no longer needed by the new implementor, but if you leave this attribute
  		blank, it will still read from the configuration file.</li>
  <li>Max tries: the maximum number of tries (original and retries) when
  		there is a connection failure (when <code>ConnectionException</code> is thrown).
  		If it is not specified, the default value is 1, namely does not retry.</li>
  <li>Retry interval: the number of seconds to wait for the next retry attempt.
  		If the value is not specified, 120 seconds is used as the default.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extending the (Poolable) Implementor</h2>
<p>Refer to <a href='AdapterActivityBase.html'>
Using Adapter Activities</a> for documentation on extending adapter in general.</p>

<p>The following lists some potential needs of customization
   and how they can be achieved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Passing meta information in addition to the request data which by default
    is passed in through <code>DATA</code> field to the bus: this can be achieved
    by overriding the method <code>getMetaData</code> in the adapter to return
    a map of such data (name-value pairs).</li>
  <li>Converting responses received normally but indicating error conditions
  	to retriable or non-retriable errors: this can be achieved by overridding
  	the <code>invoke</code> method to 
  	throw <code>ConnectionException</code> or <code>AdapterException</code>
  	accordingly.</li>
  <li>Obtaining request data from a place other than a variable configured in
    the designer: this can be achieved by overriding the <code>getRequestData</code>
    method.</li>
  <li>Saving the response to a place other than a variable configured through the 
    designer, and/or performing other post processing business logic:
    this can be achieved by overriding <code>onSuccess</code>.</li>
  <li>Performing custom retry logic and other business logic in case of failure:
    you can override <code>onFailure</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extending the Old Implementor</h2>
If your customization needs cannot be completely met by 
the attributes above, you can consider subclassing this implementor.
Refer to <a href="AdapterActivityBase.html">this link</a>
for description of overridable methods.
Additionally, you can override the methods implemented
in this class, which include:
<ul>
   <li><code>getTopicName</code></li>
   <li><code>getRequestData</code></li>
   <li><code>getResponseTimeOut</code></li>
   <li><code>getDataFieldName</code></li>
   <li><code>createBusMessage</code></li>
   <li><code>getOverrideInbox</code></li>
   <li><code>getAccount</code></li>
   <li><code>getCredential</code></li>
   <li><code>invoke</code></li>
   <li><code>openConnection</code></li>
   <li><code>closeConnection</code></li>
</ul>
