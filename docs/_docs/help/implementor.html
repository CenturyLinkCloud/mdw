<h1>Introduction on Developing Activity Implementor</h1>

The following steps are needed to define an activity implementor:
<ul>
  <li>Create an implementor Java or Kotlin class</li>
  <li>Using MDW Studio, add the implementor to the tool panel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create Implementor Class</h2>
<p>
The main requirement for an activity implementor class that extends
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/activity/DefaultActivityImpl.html">
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.activity.DefaultActivityImpl</code></a>,
or one of its subclasses, built-in or user defined. It is more common to extend
a built-in implementor class, and for adapter, task, event wait, timer wait,
synchronization activities, it is almost impossible not to start from the built-in
activities. The rest of this document covers how to implement activity
implementor from the base activity and common tasks for new implementors,
please refer to corresponding documentation when extending from a built-in activity
implementor.</p>

<p>There is really only one method that must be implemented by an activity
implementor:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>public Object execute(ActivityRuntimeContext runtimeContext) throws ActivityException</dt>
 <dd>The code logic to execute this activity. The default implementation does
      nothing.</dd>
</dl>
Additionally, you can implement the following trace annotation
<dl>
 <dt>@Tracked(LogLevel.TRACE)</dt>
 <dd>You can apply this annotation to your implementor class to automatically track timings for activity lifecycle stages.
     With the annotation applied, timings will be logged as follows if logging is turned on at the specified level for your implementation class.

 [(t)20100105.13:40:07.123 p12370.63065 a12416.14985] ScriptExecuterActivity Finish Activity: 77.64 ms</pre>
     </dd>
</dl>
<p>If the implementor needs a constructor, it must have one taking no argument,
and it should always invoke the base constructor first.</p>
<p>In a later section, we summarize all methods that are defined in the base
   class and can be used in your implementor. You should only use these methods,
   and IntelliJ/Eclipse make it easy to find out what methods are available.
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not reference to variables by their names directly, use attributes to get their names instead.
    In this way, your implementor can easily be reused in a different place, as
    variable names can be configured at design time.</li>
<li>Use getAttributeValue, so that attribute value
    can resolve <a href="bindingExpressions.html">binding expressions</a> with dynamic runtime values in addition to static text.</li>
<li>If you extend some subclasses, you may need to override some of the specific methods used by base implementation of execute(), instead. For activities implementing SuspendibleActivity, 
you will need to implement resume(), or override it from an existing implementor implementing the activity interface. </li> 
<li>Use setReturnCode() to set return code (default null). You can also set it to <code>ABORT:</code>, 
<code>CORRECT:</code>, <code>DELAY:</code>, <code>ABORT:mycode</code>, etc.
 Do not set it to <code>ERROR:</code> throw exception instead.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Pagelet</h2>
The configurator Design tab for an activity in MDW Studio requires instructions
on the configurable attributes to display.  This is achieved through a <dfn>pagelet</dfn> definition, which is
a JSON string stored as an attribute of the implementor.
As an example, the pagelet for <code>Expression Evaluator</code>
activity implementor looks like:
<pre>
    {"widgets": [
      {
        "default": "Groovy",
        "label": "Language",
        "name": "SCRIPT",
        "options": [
          "Groovy",
          "javax.el",
          "Kotlin Script",
          "JavaScript"
        ],
        "type": "dropdown"
      },
      {
        "languages": "Groovy,javax.el,Kotlin Script,JavaScript",
        "name": "Expression",
        "type": "expression"
      }
    ]}
</pre>
The pagelet description follows a simple syntax:
<ul>
   <li>Each first level child object defines a widget ,
       typically representing an attribute configurable in the activity.</li>
   <li>Each first level child object has a set of properties
       for common things like the size and location of the widget</li>
</ul>
The following table lists all supported properties of widgets.
<table border='1'>
  <tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>name</td><td>Name of the activity attribute. This is required
        if the widget describes an activity attribute.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>label</td><td>Label shown on the dialog. If this is missing,
        then NAME is used as the label</td></tr>
  <tr><td>lx</td><td>X coordinate of the label. If this is not present,
       the location will be automatically computed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ly</td><td>Y coordinate of the label. If this is not present,
       the location will be automatically computed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>lw</td><td>Width of the label. The default
       is 160 (pixels) if this is not present</td></tr>
  <tr><td>vx</td><td>X coordinate of the value area. If this is not present,
       the location will be automatically computed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>vy</td><td>Y coordinate of the value area. If this is not present,
       the location will be automatically computed.</td></tr>      
  <tr><td>vw</td><td>Width of the value area. If this is not present,
       the width of the input area takes a default value specific 
       to each widget type.</td></tr>    
  <tr><td>vh</td><td>Height of the value area. If this is not present,
       the height of the input area takes a default value specific 
       to each widget type.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Here are the supported widget types.
<dl>
  <dt>text</dt>
  <dd>A general text input field. There is no nested element. An 
  		additional attribute SIZE is used to specify the maximum
  		number of characters allowed in the text input field</dd>

  <dt>rule</dt>
  <dd>A text input area for scripting languages. There is no nested element.</dd>

  <dt>list</dt>
  <dd>This widget allows to set attribute is a list of values, separated
      by "#". The attribute DELIMITER can be used to change
      the delimiter.</dd>

  <dt>dropdown</dt>
  <dd>This displays a group of radio buttons
      for the user to select from one value
      out of a list. The list of candidate values are specified
      by child elements OPTION, one for each option.</dd>

  <dt>note</dt>
  <dd>This simply generates some static text, typically for
      instructions. The actual text to display is included
      as the contents of the tag.</dd>
  
  <dt>link</dt>
  <dd>This generates a hyper link to a URL. The URL is specified
      in the attribute "URL" and the content of the tag
      will be displayed as a hyper link. </dd>

  <dt>mapping</dt>
  <dd>This is used to specify parameter mappings for process
      invocation activities. It displays a table of formal parameters
      needed by the subprocess and allows user to specify actual
      parameters. No nested elements and no additional attributes
      are supported by this widget.</dd>
  
  <dt>table</dt>
  <dd>to be completed</dd>
  
</dl>

<h2>Configure the Implementor via Annotations</h2>
Your implementors must contain the @Activity annotation to be used.
These attributes are supported:
<ul>
  <li><s>category</s>One of the following category classes:
        <ul>
            <li>GeneralActivity - Basic activity for programmatic logic.</li>
            <li>EventWaitActivity - Wait for some event to occur.</li>
            <li>StartActivity.</li>
            <li>FinishActivity.</li>
            <li>SynchronizationActivity - Wait for multiple upstream activities to complete.</li>
            <li>InvokeProcessActivity - Launch a subflow with variable bindings.</li>
            <li>TaskActivity - Manual task activity.</li>
            <li>ScriptActivity - Invoke Kotlin, Groovy, or other supported script.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  <li><s>value</s>This is the label displayed in the MDW Studio and MDWHub toolbox.</li>
  <li><s>icon</s>Asset path for the icon to display in the toolbox.</li>
  <li><s>pagelet</s>Pagelet definition as described above.</li>
</ul>

<h2>API For Implementing Implementor</h2>

The base class <a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/activity/DefaultActivityImpl.html"><code>DefaultActivityImpl</code></a>
contains methods (API) for
assisting your implementations. Please refer to its java doc (following
above hyperlink, or through IntelliJ/Eclipse IDE) for detailed description of the methods.

<h2>Implementing Adapter Activity Implementers</h2>
Although the framework is packaged with quite a few
customizable adapter activities, it cannot be possible to cover all
needs and hence you will likely need to define an adapter activity
yourself. There are two primary ways to do this.
The first is to extend a built-in adapter. Refer to the documentation
of that adapter for how to do that.
The second is to extend the base adapter activity class,
<code>AdapterActivityBase</code>, which is an abstract class.
Follow <a href='AdapterActivityBase.html'>this link</a> for the detailed documentation for the usage of this class.
