<h1>Introduction on Developing Activity Implementor</h1>

The following steps are needed to define an activity implementor:
<ul>
  <li>Create an implementor Java class</li>
  <li>Using Designer, add the implementor to the tool panel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create Implementor Class</h2>
<p>
The main requirement for an activity implementor class that extends
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/activity/DefaultActivityImpl.html">
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.activity.DefaultActivityImpl</code></a>,
or one of its subclasses, built-in or user defined. It is more common to extend
a built-in implementor class, and for adapter, task, event wait, timer wait,
synchronization activities, it is almost impossible not to start from the built-in
activities. The rest of this document covers how to implement activity
implementor from the base activity and common tasks for new implementors,
please refer to corresponding documentation when extending from a built-in activity
implementor.</p>

<p>There is really only one method that must be implemented by an activity
implementor:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>public Object execute(ActivityRuntimeContext runtimeContext) throws ActivityException</dt>
 <dd>The code logic to execute this activity. The default implementation does
      nothing.</dd>
</dl>
Additionally, you can implement the following trace annotation
<dl>
 <dt>@Tracked(LogLevel.TRACE)</dt>
 <dd>You can apply this annotation to your implementor class to automatically track timings for activity lifecycle stages.
     With the annotation applied, timings will be logged as follows if logging is turned on at the specified level for your implementation class.

 [(t)20100105.13:40:05.232 p12370.63065 a12416.14985] ScriptExecuterActivity Prepare Activity: 0.0040 ms

 [(t)20100105.13:40:07.123 p12370.63065 a12416.14985] ScriptExecuterActivity Finish Activity: 77.64 ms</pre>
     </dd>
</dl>
<p>If the implementor needs a constructor, it must have one taking no argument,
and it should always invoke the base constructor first.</p>
<p>In a later section, we summarize all methods that are defined in the base
   class and can be used in your implementor. You should only use these methods,
   and Eclipse IDE makes it easy to find out what methods are available.
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not reference to variables by their names directly, use attributes to get their names instead.
    In this way, your implementor can easily be reused in a different place, as
    variable names can be configured at design time.</li>
<li>Use getAttributeValue, so that attribute value
    can resolve <a href="bindingExpressions.html">binding expressions</a> with dynamic runtime values in addition to static text.</li>
<li>If you extend some subclasses, you may need to override some of the specific methods used by base implementation of execute(), instead. For activities implementing SuspendibleActivity, 
you will need to implement resume(), or override it from an existing implementor implementing the activity interface. </li> 
<li>Use setReturnCode() to set return code (default null). You can also set it to <code>ABORT:</code>, 
<code>CORRECT:</code>, <code>DELAY:</code>, <code>ABORT:mycode</code>, etc.
 Do not set it to <code>ERROR:</code> throw exception instead.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Attribute Descriptor</h2>
The Attribute Definition Tab for an activity implementor
in the designer needs to be customized to allow defining attributes
specific to the implementor. The customization is achieved through an <dfn>attribute 
descriptor</dfn>, which is
an XML string stored as an attribute of the implementor.
As an example, the descriptor for <code>ScriptEvaluator</code>
activity implementor looks like:
<pre>
    &lt;PAGELET&gt;
        &lt;RULE NAME='Expression'/&gt;
        &lt;HYPERLINK URL='../doc/index.html'&gt;
            Click here for script language document&lt;/HYPERLINK&gt;
    &lt;/PAGELET&gt;
</pre>
The XML descriptors follow a simple syntax:
<ul>
   <li>The root element is always <code>PAGELET</code></li>
   <li>Each first level child element defines a widget in the dialog,
       most typically representing an attribute required by the implementor.</li>
   <li>Each first level child element has a set of attributes
       for common things like the size and location of the widget</li>
</ul>
The following table lists all supported XML attributes of widgets.
<table border='1'>
  <tr><th>XML Attribute</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>NAME</td><td>Name of the activity attribute. This is required
        if the widget describes an activity attribute.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>LABEL</td><td>Label shown on the dialog. If this is missing,
        then NAME is used as the label</td></tr>
  <tr><td>LX</td><td>X coordinate of the label. If this is not present,
       the location will be automatically computed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>LY</td><td>Y coordinate of the label. If this is not present,
       the location will be automatically computed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>LW</td><td>Width of the label. The default
       is 160 (pixels) if this is not present</td></tr>
  <tr><td>VX</td><td>X coordinate of the value area. If this is not present,
       the location will be automatically computed.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>VY</td><td>Y coordinate of the value area. If this is not present,
       the location will be automatically computed.</td></tr>      
  <tr><td>VW</td><td>Width of the value area. If this is not present,
       the width of the input area takes a default value specific 
       to each widget type.</td></tr>    
  <tr><td>VH</td><td>Height of the value area. If this is not present,
       the height of the input area takes a default value specific 
       to each widget type.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In the following we list all supported widgets.
<dl>
  <dt>TEXT</dt>
  <dd>A general text input field. There is no nested element. An 
  		additional attribute SIZE is used to specify the maximum
  		number of characters allowed in the text input field</dd>

  <dt>RULE</dt>
  <dd>A text input area for scripting languages. There is no nested element.</dd>

  <dt>LIST</dt>
  <dd>This widget allows to set attribute is a list of values, separated
      by "#". The attribute DELIMITER can be used to change
      the delimiter.</dd>

  <dt>SELECT</dt>
  <dd>This displays a group of radio buttons
      for the user to select from one value
      out of a list. The list of candidate values are specified
      by child elements OPTION, one for each option.</dd>

  <dt>NOTE</dt>
  <dd>This simply generates some static text, typically for
      instructions. The actual text to display is included
      as the contents of the tag.</dd>
  
  <dt>HYPERLINK</dt>
  <dd>This generates a hyper link to a URL. The URL is specified
      in the attribute "URL" and the content of the tag
      will be displayed as a hyper link. </dd>

  <dt>MAPPING</dt>
  <dd>This is used to specify parameter mappings for process
      invocation activities. It displays a table of formal parameters
      needed by the subprocess and allows user to specify actual
      parameters. No nested elements and no additional attributes
      are supported by this widget.</dd>
  
  <dt>TABLE</dt>
  <dd>to be completed</dd>
  
</dl>

<h2>Configure the Implementor in Designer</h2>
Your implementors must be configured in the designer to be used.
The following information needs to be provided during configuration.
<ul>
  <li>Activity Implementor Class. This is the class name of your implementor.
      When the designer is running in on-line mode (through server), it will validate the
      accessibility of the class in the server during save, so you need
      to ensure the class is deployed prior to configuring the implementor.
      The designer does not validate the class when it is not running in server mode.</li>
  <li>Activity Implementor Label. This is the label displayed
      besides the icon in the implementor tool pane. See getLabel() method above
      for additional information.</li>
  <li>Activity Type. This is a drop down list of base activity implementor class names.
      This information is used by the designer to provide activity type specific
      features and there is no runtime implication. The following describes
      the function of each type.
      <ul>
        <li>Activity. This is the basic type and there is no special functionality
            provided by the designer.</li>
   		<li>EventWaitActivity. The run time information will display external messages.</li>
   		<li>StartActivity.</li>
   		<li>FinishActivity.</li>
   		<li>SynchronizationActivity. Allows to configure synchronization in designer</li>
   		<li>InvokeProcessActivity. Allows to configure parameter passing, 
   				and subprocess names, etc.</li>
   		<li>TaskActivity. A manual task activity.</li>
   		<li>ScriptActivity. This allows the designer running inside Eclipse
   		    to pop up editor panel.</li>
      </ul></li>
  <li>Icon name. See description for getIconName() method above for additional information.
      A drop down list with all available icon names is shown for selection.</li>
  <li>Attribute descriptor. This has been described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>In MDW Designer, you only need to provide the implementor class name,
and the rest of the information can be automatically loaded by pressing the button
"Load from Class" while the server is running and the class is already accessible.</p>

<h2>API For Implementing Implementor</h2>

The base class <a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/activity/DefaultActivityImpl.html"><code>DefaultActivityImpl</code></a>
contains methods (API) for
assisting your implementations. Please refer to its java doc (following
above hyperlink, or through Eclipse IDE) for detailed description of the methods.

<h2>Implementing Adapter Activity Implementers</h2>
Although the framework is packaged with quite a few
customizable adapter activities, it cannot be possible to cover all
needs and hence you will likely need to define an adapter activity
yourself. There are two primary ways to do this.
The first is to extend a built-in adapter. Refer to the documentation
of that adapter for how to do that.
The second is to extend the base adapter activity class,
<code>AdapterActivityBase</code>, which is an abstract class.
Follow <a href='AdapterActivityBase.html'>this link</a> for the detailed documentation for the usage of this class.
