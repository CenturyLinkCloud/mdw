<h1>Slack Activity</h1>
This activity helps to integrate <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> into an MDW workflow.This is a simple activity which enables user to post messages into Slack using <a href="https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks">Incoming Webhooks</a>.
They make use of normal HTTP requests with a JSON payload, which includes the message. It allows simple one-way interaction with friendly Slack messages.This activity does not require MDW Slack app. Instead, User creates their own Incoming Slack WebHook and provides the URL in the SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL environment variable.
In this section we'll explore the steps to integrate Slack into MDW workflow.<br/>
<h3>Slack Channel creation and Integration with incoming-webhook</h3>
Go to https://slack.com/get-started  to either find your existing workspace or create a new workspace. 
Click on Launch button which opens your current workspace where you can invite people and/or add one or more channels.
Your Slack workspace is comprised of channels. You’ll use channels to hold most of your conversations with other members.
Create a new channel

<br/><br/><br/>
Once the above setup is complete, it generates incoming- Webhook URL which looks like this:<br/>
<I>Web Hook URL:</I> https://hooks.slack.com/services/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<br/>
Configure this is as an environment variable so that messages can be sent using SlackActivity.<br/> 
 mdw.slack.webhook.url=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Then restart your server. <br/>
<h3>Using Slack Activity</h3>
Using Designer or MDWHub, import the necessary Slack asset package dependency.  In MDWHub, for example, on the Admin tab click the Assets nav link and
then Import > Discover and select the `com.centurylink.mdw.slack` package in the discovered list.<br/>
Refresh Cache,In designer view, You will find <Strong>Slack Notify</Strong> activity in the Toolbox.
<h4>Design Attributes</h4>

<br/><br/><br/>
<ul>
 <li><code>Slack Web hook URL</code> has to be configured as environment variable. 
    The name of the environment variable is configurable using Slack Web hook URL attribute</li> 
 <li><code>Slack message</code> Can be either in JSON format or as process variable.
          For Json format, Note that it should be in the format  package/asset name. 
          For Ex: com.centurylink.mdw.slack/slackNotice.json</br>
          The process variable containing message or exception details can be directly assigned to slack message. 
          For Ex: $errorMessage</br>
          Refer to Json Asset SlackNotice.json located in com.centurylink.mdw.slack package for sample Json Payload.</br>  
          Refer to <a href="https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks">Incoming Webhooks</a>  
          for advanced message formatting using incoming webhook.</li>
 <li><code>Slack Message Prefix</code> allows user to append application name prefix to Json message</br></li>
 <li><code>Continue despite messaging exception</code> Checking this attribute allows the workflow process to continue in case any exception in slack Activity occurs.</li>
</ul>
