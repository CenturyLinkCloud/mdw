<h1>Using Adapter Activities</h1>

<p>TODO: Need to remove all references to connection pools and add correct information about using the PoolableAdapterBase API.</p>


<p>The class <code>AdapterActivityBase</code> is an abstract
class that provides common base for all adapter activities,
and most activities extend this base class directly.</p>

<p>The adapters can be directly used and support automatic retries through adapter configuration rather than a retry loop (a link from
it to itself) as typically used with old implementors.
In order to keep backward compatibility, we introduced a new
base class, <code>PoolableAdapterBase</code>, to support the new functionalities. This is a new implementation of JMS Adapter which can be 
configured through MDW Studio and does not implement ControlledAdapterActivity interface.

<p>MDW provides a set of common adapters for common protocols such
as SOAP based MDW web services, JMS, as well as the adapter activity, mentioned above.
These adapters are highly configurable and hence
can meet common needs in many cases. You may however
encounter situations where further customization beyond configuration is needed.
Here is a list of common reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The built-in adapters all take requests (messages to be sent to
    external systems) from a process variable, specified during configuration.
    If there is a need to get request messages from a place other than a variable,
    it can be achieved by overriding the <code>getRequestData</code>
    method to be described below.</li>
  <li>Similarly, the built-in adapters all put responses (messages received
    as responses from external systems in synchronous transport protocols)
    an a configured process variable. If there is a need to store the responses
    elsewhere, it can be achieved by overriding the method <code>onSuccess</code>.
    This method may also be needed to perform custom logics such as extracting
    or translating the responses before persistence.</li>
  <li>The built-in adapters consider reception of any response data from
    the external systems as a success, even though the response may
    indicate an error condition and may need to be retried, because such
    knowledge is external systems specific. It is common to have a need
    to convert the seemingly successful responses into failures (retriable
    and non-retriable). This can be achieved by overriding the method <code>invoke</code>.</li>
  <li>Performing custom retry logic and other business logic in case of failure:
    you can override the method <code>onFailure</code>.</li>   
  <li>Passing meta information in addition to the request messages. Meta data
    are transport protocol specific. Example is correlation ID for
    JMS adapter, in addition to the standard <code>DATA</code> field for request data.</li>
  <li>You may have a need to send messages to a system using a protocol
    not supported by any of the built-in adapters. One common case is invoking
    SOAP-based web services. In this case you will need to implement
    a brand new adapter by extending <code>PoolableAdapterBase</code>
    directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next section describes such customizations in details.</p>

<h2>Implementing Poolable Adapters</h2>
<p>A new poolable adapter should extend the abstract base class
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.adapter.PoolableAdapterBase</code>.
The following methods may be overridden less commonly:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getRequestData()</code>: this method returns the request message. The default
implementation reads it from a variable configured in MDW Studio. You can override it
to get the message from elsewhere.</li>
<li><code>onSuccess(String response)</code>: the method is invoked when the external system
returns a successful response. The method may convert external-system-detected errors into failure
by throwing an exception here (ConnectionException for retriable errors and
AdapterException for non-retriable errors), although it is preferable to perform such interpretation
in the method <code>invoke</code>, as the logic can be shared with connection pools.
Throwing an exception here
also triggers the method <code>onFailure</code> to be called.
This method is also the place to translate external responses
into internal format and persist them somewhere, if these are needed.
The default implementation stores the message in a variable configured in MDW Studio.
</li>
<li><code>onFailure(int tryCount, int maxTries, Throwable errorCause)</code>: 
The method is invoked on the failure of each try.
The outcome of the method must be one of the following:
  <ul>
    <li>throw ConnectionException. The engine will put the activity in error status,
	    and schedule automatically retry of the activity.</li>
	<li>throw AdapterException. The engine will put the activity in error status,
	    and transition based on ERROR event (typically lead to exception handler).</li>
	<li>return a completion code w/o throwing exception. The engine will complete
	    the activity and transition accordingly.</li>
  </ul>
The default implementation does the following:
  <ul>
    <li>if <var>errorCause</var> is an AdapterException, throws it.</li>
    <li>if <var>errorCause</var> is a ConnectionException:
        <ul>
          <li>if <var>tryCount</var> (the number of tries already made) is less than 
          	<var>maxTries</var> (maximum allowed tries, as configured in MDW Studio), throws it</li>
          <li>otherwise throws AdapterException with error code 
          	<code>AdapterConnectionPool.EXCEPTION_EXCEED_MAXTRIES</code>
        </ul></li>
    <li>in any other case, throw AdapterException with <var>errorCode</var> as its error code</li>
  </ul>
When you override this method, you would normally invoke this super method as the last thing,
to preserve the above logic.
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look at built-in poolable adapters as samples.
We note that the built-in adapters typically do not throw exceptions when
it receives any messages from external systems, even the messages may indicate
some error conditions (e.g. an XML message that contains an error message).
This is obviously due to the fact that there is no generic way to identify what messages indicate
errors. When you implement your application-specific adapters, which you may
have knowledge as to what response messages indicate errors, you should throw
exceptions as described above appropriately, so that the auto-retry mechanism can
function properly. </p>

<h2>Implementing Poolable Adapter Activities</h2>
<p>The built-in implementor <a href='../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/adapter/PoolableAdapterBase.html'>PoolableAdapterBase</a>
is implemented as a subclass of <code>DefaultActivityImpl</code> as well. The methods that may need to be overridden include:</
<ul>
  <li><code>doInvoke</code></li>
  <li><code>onSuccess</code></li>
  <li><code>onFailure</code></li>
  <li><code>getRequestData</code></li>
</ul>
