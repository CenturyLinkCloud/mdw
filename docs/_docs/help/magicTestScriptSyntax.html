<h1>Magic Test Script Syntax</h1>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Note:</span> Magic syntax for <a href="automatedTesting.html">MDW Automated Testing</a>
is deprecated.  For new test cases, <a href="groovyTestScriptSyntax.html">Groovy syntax</a> is recommended. 
</p>
<p>
Similar to Unix Shell, each command in the command file is a list of words in the same
line, delimited by spaces.
The first word is called the <em>command</em> and the rests are <em>arguments</em>.
For arguments that contain spaces, newlines, and other special characters, there
are several escaping mechanisms.
<ul>
  <li>Double quotes around the argument can be used to escape when the argument
      contains spaces, tabs, "@" or "&lt;", but not new lines and double quotes themselves.
      An empty string argument must also be escaped this way (as <code>""</code>).</li>
  <li>If the argument contains newlines or double quotes, the argument
      can be escaped by a preceding "&lt;&lt;<i>tag</i>\n", where
      <i>tag</i> is a sequence of any characters (except spaces, newlines, tabs)
      till the new line, and by a succeeding "\n<i>tag</i>&gt;&gt;", where <i>tag</i>
      must be the exactly same sequence of characters. Here is an example:
      <pre>
        message Bus &lt;&lt;MyMessage
        &lt;ping&gt;
           Hello, World!
        &lt;/ping&gt;
        
        MyMessage&gt;&gt;
      </pre>
      Note that there are two newlines at the end of argument: the first is part of
      the message, and the second is part of the end tag. There will be only
      one newline if the message text does not end with a newline.
      </li>
  <li>An alternative way of escaping XML contents, service order or other long arguments
      is to put them in files. The files must reside in the test case directory,
      and the argument will be the file name preceded by a "@", as in
      <pre>
        message Bus @MyMessage.xml
      </pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The following lists all the commands currently supported along with their expected
arguments and descriptions.

<dl>

<dt>delete_process <i>process-name</i>/<i>version</i></dt>
<dd>The command delete the process definition of the given name and version.
If version is not specified, the command deletes the latest version of the process.</dd>

<dt>echo <i>arg<sub>1</sub></i> ... ... <i>arg<sub>n</sub></i></dt>
<dd>Echo all the arguments to the log file.</dd>

<dt>export <i>package-name</i>/<i>version</i> <i>file-name</i></dt>
<dd>The command exports the specified package to the file name
specified in the second argument. Note that the file name should not be
proceeded with "@" because we use the name itself as data.
When version is omitted, the command exports the most recent version of the package.
An example of the command is
<pre>
    export "My Package/0.8" package.xml
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>import <i>package-xml</i></dt>
<dd>The command imports a package, whose XML string is the first (only) argument.
Since the XML string is always long, you will typically need to use one of the
escaping mechanisms described above, typically a file. An example of the command is
<pre>
    import @myPackage.xml
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>master_request_id <i>value</i></dt>
<dd>The command sets the master request ID to be used for the case.
Typically you should not specify this and the tester will automatically generate one.
You can set the value to <code>"#"</code> (including double-quotes as pound is
a special character) and the tester will generate a master request ID that contains only
numeric characters.
The location of this command is insignificant as it is pre-processed.
</dd>
  
<dt>message <i>protocol</i> <i>message</i></dt>
<dd>send a message (external event) to the application, using the specified
protocol, which can be <code>Bus</code>, <code>Jms</code>, <code>WebService</code>
(requires that the message be wrapped in a SOAP envelope),
<code>RestfulWebService</code>, <code>Ejb</code> (for MDW 5.2, this is really
going through RMI), or <code>Default</code> (use the communication protocol the designer
is using). The message can contain filters which will be replaced
as described in the section Filtering.
<br>
The default listener for the corresponding protocol
will receive the message. Using the escaping mechanism explained above if the message
contains spaces or other characters not allowed in simple arguments.
<br>
This command can be used to start a process, invoke a service process, or send
an intermediate message to existing process instances, depending on the configuration
of external event handlers.
</dd>

<dt>notify <i>event-name</i> <i>message</i> <i>process-name</i> <i>activity-logical-id</i></dt>
<dd>Send a process notification message (internal message publishing), with the given event name
and message. The event name can have the following server side place holders (translated on the
server side)
<ul>
  <li><code>{$MasterRequestId}</code>: replaced by the master request ID of the test case run.</li>
  <li><code>{$ProcessInstanceId}</code>: replaced by the ID of the process instance 
      of the given process name and the master request ID of the test case run.</li>
  <li><code>{$ActivityInstanceId}</code>: replaced by the ID of the activity instance
        with the given activity logical ID
        in the process instance of the given process name and the master request ID 
        of the test case run.</li>
  <li><code>{$<i>variable-name</i>}</code>: replaced by the value of the variable instance
      with the given name in the process instance of the given process name and the master request ID 
      of the test case run.</li>
</ul>
The arguments <i>process-name</i> and <i>activity-logical-id</i> are used
for the server side to perform place holder translations, so they do not need to be
specified if there are no server side place holders.
The following is a sample notify command:
<pre>
notify ModifyPlugInCompleted-MODIFY_PLUGIN:{$ActivityInstanceId}-{$OrderNumber} @modifyplugin_realresponse.xml Task1ApplyChangesServiceProcess A7
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>sleep <i>seconds</i></dt>
<dd>The test thread is put to sleep for the given amount of a seconds, before
proceeding to the next command.</dd>

<dt>start <i>process-name</i> <i>var<sub>1</sub></i>=<i>value<sub>1</sub></i> ... ...
 <i>var<sub>n</sub></i>=<i>value<sub>n</sub></i></dt>
<dd>Start the specified process directly. This is one way to start running
processes in the regression tester.
The command sends a JMS message directly to the internal process message queue,
without going through external event handlers.
The other way of starting processes is through the command "message", which
can be used to start processes by sending messages to the external event queue.
<br>
If a specific version of process is needed, you can use the syntax <i>process-name</i>/<i>version</i>,
such as <code>MyProcess/3.2</code>. Otherwise the latest version of the process
will be launched.
<br>
You can specify input variable bindings from the third argument on.
<br>
A master request ID is automatically generated here and is visible through the
regression tester screen.
</dd>

<dt>stub <i>condition</i> <i>delay</i> <i>response</i></dt>
<dd>
The command defines a stub response when the regression tester
intercepts an adapter request that satisfy the specified condition.
The condition is either in <a href='xpath.html'>MDW supported Xpath</a>
syntax (the same as those used in external event handler configuration)
or in <a href='magicbox.html'>MagicBox Rule Language</a>
syntax for conditions. The latter may be needed for conditions not possible
to be expressed by Xpath. The command treats the condition as a MagicBox
one when it contains <code>$</code>, and treats it as an XPath otherwise.
A sample command to match a request message with root element tag <code>MyRequest</code>
looks like below in XPath syntax:
<pre>
stub MyRequest 5 @MyResponse.xml
</pre>
and it may look like below using MagicBox syntax:
<pre>
stub &lt;&lt;MYRESP
&amp;$$=="MyRequest"
MYRESP&gt;&gt; 5 @MyResponse.xml
</pre>
The argument <i>delay</i> specifies delays in seconds
for sending the response, and this may be useful for load testing to emulate
the speed of external systems. The argument <i>response</i> 
can contain filters, especially filters that refer to the content
of the corresponding request.
<br>
This command is unique in the sense that its location is only meaningful
to other stub commands but irrelevant to non-stub commands, so
it is more a declaration than a command. When a request is 
is processed, the first stub command whose condition is satisfied
will provide the response.
</dd>

<dt>task <i>task-name</i> <i>task-action</i> <i>var<sub>1</sub></i>=<i>value<sub>1</sub></i> ... ...
 <i>var<sub>n</sub></i>=<i>value<sub>n</sub></i></dt>
<dd>Perform an action on the task instance with the given task name and the master
request ID of the test case. The task action can be either built-in ones
or user defined ones (through process definition). From the fourth argument,
you can specify variable values, emulating users inputing variable values
in the task manager.</dd>

<dt>verify_process <i>process-name</i><sub>1</sub> ... ... <i>process-name</i><sub>n</sub></dt>
<dd>Verify the instances of the processes specified here. 
The command generate comparisons for these processes and set success/failure flag
for the case.
<br>
The regression tester will use the latest version of the processes.
If a specific version of process is needed, you can use the syntax <i>process-name</i>/<i>version</i>,
such as <code>MyProcess/3.2</code>.
You must specify at least one process.
<br>
Typically, this is the last command in a case to execute
for regular processes. To accommodate dynamic content such as master request ID
and process instance ID, filtering mechanism can be used - see the section below
on filtering for details.
</dd>

<dt>verify_response <i>expected-response</i></dt>
<dd>This is typically used to test service processes, and
it verifies the actual response is the same as expected
response, which is the first argument of the command
(again, you can use escape syntax to specify large document),
after applying filtering.
<br>
Typically, this is the last command in a case to execute
for service processes.
</dd>

<dt>wait <i>process-name</i> <i>activity-logical-id</i> <i>status</i> <i>timeout</i></dt>
<dd>Wait until an activity instance with the specified logical ID in
the specified process reaches the specified status. The statuses
can be <code>Completed</code>, <code>Cancelled</code>, <code>Failed</code>,
<code>Waiting</code>, and <code>Hold</code>. If the matching
event is not detected within <i>timeout</i> seconds, the test case is failed.
There are two variants of this command:
<ul>
   <li>If <i>status</i> is omitted (with only 3 arguments: <i>process-name</i>,
      <i>activity-logical-id</i> and <i>timeout</i>), then the command
      waits for <code>Completed</code> status.</li>
   <li>If <i>activity-logical-id</i> is also omitted (with only 2 arguments:
      <i>process-name</i> and <i>timeout</i>), then the command
      will wait for the specified process to complete.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt># <i>anything-else</i></dt>
<dd>A line starting with the character "#" is considered a comment line
  and the line is ignored.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Filtering</h2>
<p>As we have mentioned a few times before, the filtering mechanism is
useful in many situations, including:</p>
<ol>
  <li>When sending messages to listeners, filters allow
     a single message template to be used for with slightly different
     values, to be filled by either dialog (functional tester) or
     CSV files (regression and load tester).</li>
  <li>When sending stub responses, in addition to above, filters
     can also be used to pick up values from the request messages.</li>
  <li>When verify results (comparing expected
     variable values and service process responses with actual ones),
     filters can again be used for dynamic contents in expected results
     (such as master request ID).</li>
  <li>When sending process notifications to waiting activity instances, the event name
     may contain dynamic values such as process instance IDs that cannot be
     directly used in test cases.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are 4 types of filter tokens that can be used with one or more
situations above.</p>

<h3>Place Holders</h3>
<p>The syntax for place holder is <code>#{$<i>place-holder-name</i>}</code>.
For functional testing, the tester prompts for the actual values to replace,
and for regression/load testing, the values are taken from the test case
file <code>placeHolderMap.csv</code>.
Additionally, the following two place holders have special meaning:</p>
<ul>
   <li><code>#{$MasterRequestId}</code>: will be replaced by the master request ID
       of the test case run.</li>
   <li><code>#{$RunNumber}</code>: for load testing, a test case is run
       multiple times, and this is replaced by the run number (starting from 0);
       for regression testing, this is always replaced by 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>Place holders can be used for sending messages, sending stub responses
as well as for standard results.</p>
<p>For compatibility with earlier versions of MDW (all MDW 5.0 and 5.1 versions,
   MDW 4 versions before 4.5.20), and in functional tester only,
   the place holders can also take the syntax <code>{$<i>place-holder-name}</i></code>,
   namely without the leading <code>#</code>. Additionally,
   <code>%%M%%</code> is treated the same as <code>#{$MasterRequestId}</code>.</p>

<h3>Expressions</h3>
<p>For sending stub responses, there may be a need to copy some dynamic 
data from the request messages to the response messages (e.g. correlation ID).
The syntax <code>#{<i>Magic-box-expression</i>}</code> can be used to
places the result of evaluating the expression in Magic Box syntax, 
if the request message is in XML or JSON format.
The documentation for MagicBox expression can be found
<a href='magicbox.html'>here</a>.</p>

<h3>Any Number</h3>
<p>For expected results, we have a special filter token, <code>#{#}</code>, that
can match any number (a sequence of digits) in the actual results.
This is handy in many cases
where a number such as document ID is generated and we do not really care
whether its value is correct.</p>

<h3>Server Side Place Holders</h3>
<p>When sending process notification to notify waiting activity instances,
the event names registered by the activity instances quite often
contains dynamic data such as master request ID, process instance ID,
activity instance ID, or process variable instance values.
The event name parameter of the command <code>notify</code> allows
the following server side place holders:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>{$MasterRequestId}</code>: replaced by the master request ID of the test case
    run.</li>
  <li><code>{$ProcessInstanceId}</code>: replaced by the ID of the process instance
    of the given process and the master request ID of the test case run.</li>
  <li><code>{$ActivityInstanceId}</code>: replaced by the ID of activity instance
    of the activity with the given logical ID, in the process instance
    of the given process and the master request ID of the test case run.</li>
  <li><code>{$<i>variable-name</i>}</code>: replaced by the value of
    the variable instance in the process instance
    of the given process and the master request ID of the test case run.</li>
</ul>
<p>These place holders are called <i>server side place holders</i> because their
values are replaced on the server side when processing the notify command,
as the relevant information can only be derived on the server side.
The process name and/or the activity logical ID must be
supplied to the server through the third and fourth arguments of 
the notify command, to allow the filtering to happen.</p>

<p>Server side place holders can only be used when there is exactly
one process instance for the given process name and the master request ID
of the test case run. Similarly, when activity instance ID is used
as a place holder, there needs to be exactly one activity instance
for the activity of the given logical ID in the matching process instance.</p>

<h2>Load Testing</h2>

<p>The loader tester can run most test cases defined for regression testing.
The following commands are ignored (null operation) for load testing:
<code>import</code>, <code>export</code>, <code>delete_process</code>,
<code>verify_process</code> and <code>verify_response</code>.</p>
<p>The load tester runs each of the selected test cases multiple times
(the number is specified in the text field <dfn>Number of runs</dfn>
in the start dialog). You can use <code>placeHolderMap.csv</code>
to supply different values for different runs. The load tester
uses the rows in the file sequentially. If the number of runs
is larger than the number of rows in the file, the load tester
will repeat from the first row again once the last row is used.
The special place holder <code>#{$MasterRequestId}</code> will
be generated with different values for different runs (please do not
specify 0 as run interval, as the uniqueness of the master request ID
generation depends on the current time in terms of seconds).
The special place holder <code>#{$RunNumber}</code> is assigned as
0, 1, 2, and so on for each run of the same case.</p>
<p>Currently a single run number is specified and
every selected case runs the same number of times. A future
extension is to support different numbers of runs for different
test cases, better emulating a real production environment.
</p>

<p>The load tester does not validate the correctness of the cases
as the regression tester does, instead it focus on the overall
throughput. So test cases to be used for load testing should be
good cases, namely verified already by the regression tester.</p>

<p>The load tester does not generate any per-case result files.
Instead, a summary report about some performance statistics
is generated and placed directly under the directory
specified by <dfn>Suite Result Directory</dfn>.</p>
