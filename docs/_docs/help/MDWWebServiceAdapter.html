<h1>Using the MDW RPC Web Service Adapter Activity</h1>
<p>Note: This implementor is used to consume RPC-style web services that use a specific WSDL.
<br/>
For a general-purpose adapter which can consume services using other WSDL's, refer to the <a href="DocWebServiceAdapter.html">Document Web Service Adapter</a> activity.

<p>The class <code><a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/adapter/soap/MdwRpcWebServiceAdapter.html">
com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.activity.MdwRcpWebServiceAdapter</a></code>
implements an adapter that can be used to invoke standard
MDW web services, which has a single port named <code>invokeWebService</code>
which takes two arguments: the first is a service name (which is passed to
the listener of the receiving end as meta data and is not typically used),
and the other is an XML request data in Java <code>String</code>
format. The return value is an XML response data in
string format as well:</p>
<pre>
     String invokeWebService(String service, String request)
             throws AdapterException;
</pre>

The new implementor supports usage in connection
pools (see <a href='AdapterActivityBase.html'>
Using Adapter Activities</a> for introduction on poolable adapters),
and it allows to configure automatic retries with the activity.</p>

<p><em>Important note</em>: with the new (poolable) implementor, you should not use
the retry loop (a link to itself with the label <code>ERROR:RETRY</code>) 
for the old implementor.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>
The following attributes are used by both implementors (old and new):
<ul>
  <li><code>WSDL</code>:
     This is used to specify the WSDL location. It can take
     either the standard URL form with HTTP protocol,
     or a property defined in the MDW or application config file
     using the standard MDW <a href="bindingExpressions.html">binding expressions</a> syntax:
     <code>#{props['my.wsdl.url']}</code>.
  </li>
  <li><code>Service Name</code>:
  	Specifies the service name. The value will be passed to the receiving
  	MDW application's listener to its event handlers as a meta data field. This
  	is not typically used, so unless requested by the receiving application
  	specifically, you can specify any value.
  </li>
  <li><code>Request Variable</code>:
  	The name of the variable that holds the string XML data
  	of the request.
  </li>
  <li><code>Response Variable</code>:
  	The name of the variable that holds the string XML data
  	of the response.
  </li>
  <li><code>Log req/resp</code>:
    A boolean attribute indicating whether the request/response
    of the external system should be logged in 
    the database (table DOCUMENT for MDW 5.* and ADAPTER_INSTANCE for MDW 4.*).
  </li>
  <li><code>Request XSD</code>:
    A URL indicating the location of XSD for the request.
    This is for documentation purpose only and has no runtime effect.
  </li>
  <li><code>Response XSD</code>:
    A URL indicating the location of XSD for the response.
    This is for documentation purpose only and has no runtime effect.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The following additional attributes are supported by the new implementor only:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Max tries: the maximum number of tries (original and retries) when
  		there is a connection failure (when <code>ConnectionException</code> is thrown).
  		If it is not specified, the default value is 1, namely does not retry.</li>
  <li>Retry interval: the number of seconds to wait for the next retry attempt.
  		If the value is not specified, the default is  120 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extending the (Poolable) Implementor</h2>
<p>Refer to <a href='AdapterActivityBase.html'>
Using Adapter Activities</a> for documentation on extending poolable
implementor in general.</p>

<p>The following lists some potential needs of customization
   and how they can be achieved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Converting responses received normally but indicating error conditions
  	to retriable or non-retriable errors: this can be achieved by overridding
  	the <code>invoke</code> method to 
  	throw <code>ConnectionException</code> or <code>AdapterException</code>
  	accordingly.</li>
  <li>Obtaining request data from a place other than a variable configured in
    the designer: this can be achieved by overriding the <code>getRequestData</code>
    method.</li>
  <li>Saving the response to a place other than a variable configured through the 
    designer, and/or performing other post processing business logic:
    this can be achieved by overriding <code>onSuccess</code> .</li>
  <li>Performing custom retry logic and other business logic in case of failure:
    you can override <code>onFailure</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Extending the Old Implementor</h2>
If your customization needs cannot be completely met by 
the attributes above, you can consider subclassing this implementor.
Refer to <a href="AdapterActivityBase.html">this link</a>
for description of overridable methods.
Additionally, you can override the methods implemented
in this class, which include:
<ul>
   <li><code>invoke</code>
   </li>
   <li><code>openConnection</code>
   </li>
   <li><code>closeConnection</code>
   </li>
</ul>
