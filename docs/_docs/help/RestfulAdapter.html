<h1>RESTful Adapter Activity</h1>

The MDW RESTful Adapter Activity provides the ability to invoke a RESTful service from a workflow process, binding the service Request and Response to process variables.
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Design Attributes</h3>
The basic design parameters for configuring a RESTful Adapter Activity are illustrated in the screenshot below.
<br/><br/>
The first attribute to specify is the HTTP method of your service request.
According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">RESTful design principles</a>, GET requests should be used for non-impactful resource retrieval, while POST request can be used for operations that create or update data.
Typically the request and response variables are Document-type variables which hold XML content according to a previously agreed XSD.
For GET requests, the Request Variable attribute is not required and will be ignored if specified.
<br/><br/>
The Timeout settings are optional, as is the Headers Variable.
If you specify a variable for the HTTP Headers, this variable must be of type java.util.Map and should contain String key/value pairs with the desired headers.
The XSD URL attributes are for information only and are not used at runtime.
<br/><br/>
The Restful Adapter supports "Http Basic Authentication" for any targeted web services that require a user/password. The user can enter a user/password combination which will be encoded as per the Basic Authentication guidelines, and sent with each request.
<br/><br/>
Please note that to enable this Http Basic Authentication functionality, you have to set the property below in your mdw.yaml file.
<br/><br/>
<code>mdw.http.listeners.auth.mode=Basic</code>
