<h1>Process Cleanup Scheduled Job</h1> 
To enable the process cleanup scheduled job, set the following properties in the
MDW configuration file (mdw.properties):
<pre>
  # Scheduled job - process clean up.
  mdw.timer.task.ProcessCleanup.TimerClass=com.centurylink.mdw.timer.cleanup.ProcessCleanup
  # run daily at 2:30 am
  mdw.timer.task.ProcessCleanup.Schedule=30 2 * * ? *
  # cleanup script to execute from scheduled job
  MDWFramework.ProcessCleanup-RuntimeCleanupScript=Cleanup-Runtime.sql
  # minimum age (in days) before process instance data is eligible for cleanup
  MDWFramework.ProcessCleanup-ProcessExpirationAgeInDays=180
  # maximum number of instance rows to clean up during one job execution
  MDWFramework.ProcessCleanup-MaximumProcessExpiration=10000
  # minimum age (in days) before event instance data is eligible for cleanup
  MDWFramework.ProcessCleanup-ExternalEventExpirationAgeInDays=180
</pre>
In this example the MDW db cleanup job is scheduled to run every day at 2:30 am and will delete process and event instance data for completed processes older than 180 days.

<br><br>The default MDW cleanup scripts are available here:
<a href="https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/blob/master/mdw/database/Cleanup-Runtime.sql">Cleanup-Runtime</a>
 
<br><br>
These scripts are built into the MDW framework modules, so if these defaults are suitable then they don't need to be deployed separately with a workflow application.  If an application has custom cleanup requirements, then they can deliver a custom version of Cleanup-Runtime.sql (or any other name referenced in the property setting).  The custom cleanup script should be delivered into the application configuration directory.
