<h1>Process Cleanup Scheduled Job</h1> 
To enable the process cleanup scheduled job, set the following properties in the
MDW configuration file (mdw.properties):
<br>
  # Scheduled job - process clean up.
  <br>
  <code>mdw.timer.task.ProcessCleanup.TimerClass=com.centurylink.mdw.timer.cleanup.ProcessCleanup</code>
  <br># run daily at 2:30 am
  <br><code>mdw.timer.task.ProcessCleanup.Schedule=30 2 * * ? *</code>
  <br># cleanup script to execute from scheduled job
  <br><code>MDWFramework.ProcessCleanup-RuntimeCleanupScript=Cleanup-Runtime.sql</code>
  <br># minimum age (in days) before process instance data is eligible for cleanup
  <br><code>MDWFramework.ProcessCleanup-ProcessExpirationAgeInDays=180</code>
  <br># maximum number of instance rows to clean up during one job execution
  <br><code>MDWFramework.ProcessCleanup-MaximumProcessExpiration=10000</code>
  <br># minimum age (in days) before event instance data is eligible for cleanup
  <br><code>MDWFramework.ProcessCleanup-ExternalEventExpirationAgeInDays=180</code>
<br><br>
In this example the MDW db cleanup job is scheduled to run every day at 2:30 am and will delete process and event instance data for completed processes older than 180 days.

<br><br>The default MDW cleanup scripts are available here:
<a href="https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/blob/master/mdw/database/Cleanup-Runtime.sql">Cleanup-Runtime</a>
 
<br><br>
These scripts are built into the MDW framework modules, so if these defaults are suitable then they don't need to be deployed separately with a workflow application.  If an application has custom cleanup requirements, then they can deliver a custom version of Cleanup-Runtime.sql (or any other name referenced in the property setting).  The custom cleanup script should be delivered into the application configuration directory.
