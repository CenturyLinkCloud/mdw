<h1>MDW Cloud Mode Considerations</h1>

MDW applications deployed in Cloud Mode consist of business logic that's developed entirely in the form of workflow assets.  
Examples of these assets include Processes, Rules, Pages, Scripts, Templates, Reports, Camel Routes, Dynamic Java, and even Jar archives.  
MDW supports the ability for clients to collaborate in developing workflow processes and assets without needing to install any local infrastructure.  
To distinguish non-cloud mode we refer to this as Dedicated Mode.  It's important to note that this doesn't mean that dedicated hardware 
is provisioned for non-cloud deployments (which are almost always hosted in a virtualized environment).  
The distinction is more accurately understood as avoiding the need for a custom application 
deployable (such as an EAR file, WAR file, or OSGi bundle).  
Cloud-based projects still allow users to deploy custom Java code, but without any application deployment 
in the traditional sense.  Access controls are rigorously enforced through role-based authorization, 
with versioning, rollback and strict audit logging to ensure accountability.  
To insulate workflow apps from others hosted in the same environment, 
configuration settings for a cloud-based project apply at the workflow package level.
 
<br/><br/>
To help guide the decision about which is the right development model for a particular situation, 
the table below summarizes key differences between cloud and dedicated modes.  
In general, if your project involves an extensive existing codebase or 
needs direct access to container resources, you should consider choosing the dedicated deployment model; 
otherwise you may prefer the simplicity and rapid startup afforded by the cloud model.  
Either way, this decision is strictly a design-time issue.  
At runtime workflows are processed by the MDW engine in exactly the same way regardless of the model used to create them.
