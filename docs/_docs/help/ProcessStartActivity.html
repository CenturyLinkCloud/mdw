<h1>Using Activity Implementor ProcessStartActivity</h1>

This activity is the standard process start activity.

<h2>How to Start a Process</h2>
There are many ways to start a process. Here is a list of them:
<ol>
  <li>Started by an external event handler, especially the start process event handler,
      in response to receiving a message from external systems.</li>
  <li>Started by a parent process. </li>
  <li>Started by a pre-flow task (see <a href="customWeb.html">Custom Web</a> for an introduction)</li>
  <li>Started by a remote process (a process running in a different MDW application)</li>
  <li>Started by a <a href="scheduledJobs.html">Scheduled Job</a></li>
  <li>Started by a rules engine as result of constraint propagation (not yet implemented)</li>
  <li>Started directly via REST message - this is for testing purpose only and
  		can be triggered from the MDW Studio and/or MDWHub.</li>
</ol>
The first two forms are the most common ways to start a process.

<h2>How to Initialize Variables in a Process</h2>
For processes started by another process or by a remote process,
the variables are initialized through the variable binding mechanism described
in the <a href="InvokeSubProcessActivity.html#subprocessVariableBindings">Subprocess Variable Bindings</a>.
<p>
For processes started by pre-flow tasks and external event handlers,
the owner ID of the process instance is the document ID containing
the external message (in case of pre-flow tasks, this message is a form data document).
So there is no general need to extract the data into variables.
<p>
If you do want to extract some data into process variables, you can
either configure this activity to achieve that, or subclass this activity,
as described below.
<p>
An older approach, not recommended any more, is to extract the data in a custom
external event handler and pass them to the process. Only variables in input mode
or input/output mode can be passed.
<p>
For general topics on <em>listeners and external event handling</em>,
please follow <a href="listener.html">this link</a>.

<h2>Configure This Activity</h2>
If you do want to initialize variables from data
received from external systems, you can configure the 
attribute "Variable Initialization" of this activity.
<p>
The attribute specifies how variables should be initialized
when the process is started via an external event, including a
pre-flow task (owner type is DOCUMENT).
It is a map. The value of each variable
can be a <a href="xpath.html">MDW XPath expression</a>
(identified by starting with "xpath:") or constants.
<p>
Here are examples of variable initialization specification:
<table>
<tr><td>my_var_1</td><td>xpath:/OrderHeader/OrderNumber</td></tr>
<tr><td>my_var_2</td><td>a Static Value</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
You do not need to initialize every variable. Variables that
are not specifically initialized will have null values.
The XPath expression is applied to the external message that
triggered the process instance.

<em>In mdw6, xpath expressions are replaced with java value expressions.</em>
<p>
Here are examples of variable initialization through java expression:
<table>
<tr><td>my_var_1</td><td>${request['OrderHeader/OrderNumber']}</td></tr>
<tr><td>my_var_2</td><td>${request.OrderNumber}</td></tr>
<tr><td>my_var_3</td><td>a Static Value</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The Java value expression is applied to the request variable which is created with <em>input mode</em> under the process.

<h2>Subclassing This Implementor</h2>
You can subclass this implementor to perform
additional tasks at the process start, although in general
you may want to use a separate activity instead.
