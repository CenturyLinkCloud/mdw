<h1>Managing Events</h1>
<p>MDW provides an event management GUI, accessible through
Eclipse Designer by right-clicking on the workflow project in Process Explorer view and selecting Swing Tools > Event Manager.   
EventManager can be used to view and manage both external and internal events, as well as
other event-like things such as scheduled jobs and event logs.
The event manager has a tab for each type of events it manages.
</p>

<h2><a id="scheduledJobs">Managing Scheduled Jobs</a></h2>
Event Manager is meant as a diagnostic tool for troubleshooting.
The preferred way to configure Scheduled Jobs is through the MDW properties file as described in the
<a href="scheduledJobs.html">Scheduled Jobs documentation</a>.

<p>The Scheduled Jobs tab is used to manage scheduled jobs (known previously as
as timer tasks). The scheduled jobs are also stored in the database table EVENT_INSTANCE,
with STATUS_CD having the value 5.
The following picture shows the tab as seen in the classic Designer.</p>
<img src='images/eventmgr_schedjob.jpg'/>
<p>The descriptions of the columns are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create Time: the time when the scheduled job is created.</li>
  <li>Event Name: has the format <code>ScheduledJob.<var>java-timer-task-class-name</var></code> and
    it can take optional arguments in the same syntax as URL arguments.
    This is to ensure that event names are unique among all entries in the EVENT_INSTANCE table.</li>
  <li>Next Run: the time for the next scheduled run.</li>
  <li>Schedule: a cron expression defining the schedule of the job.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the command buttons on this screen to create, modify and delete
   scheduled jobs.</p>

<h2>Managing External Events</h2>
<p>The External Events tab is used to manage entries in the database table EVENT_INSTANCE
that are used to match external events with registered waiting activity instances
(with STATUS_CD 0, 1, 2 and 3, whose meanings are explained below).
The following picture shows the tab as seen in the classic Designer.</p>
<img src='images/eventmgr_extevent.jpg'/>
<p>The descriptions of the columns are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create Time: the time when the entry is created, either when the external
  	event arrives, or when an activity registers waiting for it, whichever happens
  	first.</li>
  <li>Event Name: this is unique among all entries in the EVENT_INSTANCE table.</li>
  <li>Event Status: the English description of STATUS_CD. They can be:
  	<ul>
  		<li>&ldquo;Waiting&rdquo; (0 - ): an activity is waiting for the event,
  			which has not arrived yet. The event can recur but cannot have multiple
  			waiting activity instances.</li>
  		<li>&ldquo;Waiting-multiple&rdquo; (1): one or more activity is waiting
  			for the event which has not arrived yet. The event cannot recur but
  			can have multiple waiting activity instances.</li>
  		<li>&ldquo;Arrived&rdquo; (2): the event has arrived, but no activity instance
  			is registered to consume it.</li>
  		<li>&ldquo;Consumed-multiple&rdquo; (3): the event is arrived and 
  			has also been consumed by at least one activity instance. The event cannot
  			recur but can have multiple activity instances registered to consume it.
  	</ul>
    Note for event that can recur, once it is consumed, the entry is removed from
    the database, hence there is not a status such as &ldquo;Consumed&rdquo; for it.</li>
  <li>Document ID. If the message has arrived, the ID of the document holding the message
  	is shown here. Double-click on the entry will show the message content in a dialog.</li>
  <li>Consume Time: the time the event is consumed. In case of multiple waiting instances,
    this is the time the even is last consumed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the command buttons on this screen to manually create, modify and delete
   the entries, although this functionality is provided only for recovering from bad system
   errors, and should be used with extreme caution.</p>
<p>You can also view which activity instances are waiting for the event, using
the button &ldquo;View Waiting Instances&rdquo;</p>


<h2>Managing Internal Events</h2>
<p>The Internal Events tab is used to manage delayed internal events, which 
are used to implement timer wait activities and time out for event wait activities.
The delayed internal events are also stored in the database table EVENT_INSTANCE,
with STATUS_CD having the value 7.</p>
<img src='images/eventmgr_intevent.jpg'/>
<p>The descriptions of the columns are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create Time: the time when the entry is created.</li>
  <li>Event Name: has the format <code>InternalEvent.<var>activity-instance-id</var></code>,
    where the activity instance ID is the ID of the timer wait or event wait
    activity instance.
    This is to ensure that event names are unique among all entries in the EVENT_INSTANCE table.</li>
  <li>Scheduled Time: the time when the internal event should be fired.</li>
  <li>Message: the actual internal event message content.</li>
  <li>Reference: this field is not currently used.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the command buttons on this screen to manually create, modify and delete
   the entries, although this functionality is provided only for recovering from bad system
   errors, and should be used with extreme caution.</p>
<h2>Using and Managing Runtime Flags</h2>
<p>The Flags tab is used to manage run time flags - events recorded
and checked by API, typically in custom activity
implementors or custom event handlers. It is used to indicate whether an event
has happened, and is another way to coordinate between
independent processes. The run time flags are also stored in the database 
table EVENT_INSTANCE,
with STATUS_CD having the value 4.</p>
The following picture shows the tab as seen in the classic Designer.</p>
<img src='images/eventmgr_flag.jpg'/>
<p>The descriptions of the columns are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create Time: the time when the flag is created.</li>
  <li>Event Name: this is unique among all entries in the EVENT_INSTANCE table.</li>
  <li>Preserve internal: the number of seconds this entry must be minimally
  		kept in the database, before the clean-up script removes it.</li>
  <li>Reference: the value is for searching purpose and set by API call.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the command buttons on this screen to manually create, modify and delete
   the entries.</p>

<h2>Managing Documents</h2>
<p>The Documents tab is used to manage documents, entries
    in the database table DOCUMENT.
The following picture shows the tab as seen in the classic Designer.</p>
<img src='images/eventmgr_document.jpg'/>
<p>The descriptions of the columns are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create Time: the time when the document is created.</li>
  <li>Document ID: the ID of the document. Double click on this
  		will show the content of the document in a dialog box,
  		and you can actually modify its content, type, owner type,
  		owner ID and associated process instance ID here if you 
  		have runtime data administration privilege.</li>
  <li>Owner Type: the type of the designated owner of the document. 
  	The owner is used for clean up purpose. The document will be cleaned
  	when its owner is cleaned from the database. The owner type for document
  	can be:
  	<ul>
  		<li>LISTENER_REQUEST: the document is the content of an external
  			event. The owner ID is the external event handler ID or 0 when that
  			is not available. </li>
  		<li>LISTENER_RESPONSE: the document is the content of the message
  			sent back to the external system after receiving
  			an external event from it. The owner ID is the 
  			ID of the document holding the request (the external event content).</li>
  		<li>ADAPTER_REQUEST: the document is the content of a message
  			sent to an external system by an adapter activity.
  			The owner ID is the activity instance ID.</li>
  		<li>ADAPTER_RESPONSE: the document is the content of the synchronous 
  			response received from an external system after an adapter
  			activity sends a message to it.
  			The owner ID is the activity instance ID. Note that
  			if the response from the external system is received asynchronously,
  			it will be picked up by MDW listeners and the document owner
  			type will be LISTENER_REQUEST. </li>  			
  		<li>VARIABLE_INSTANCE: the document is the content of a document
  			variable. The owner ID is the variable instance ID. </li>
  		<li>TASK_INSTANCE: the document is the form data document
  			associated with a task instance. The owner ID is the
  			task instance ID.</li>
  		<li>PROCESS_INSTANCE: this is for miscellaneous use
  		    by a process instance, such as documents created
  		    from input parameters when the process instance is started,
  		    documents created as a result of completing manual tasks,
  		    etc.
  		    The owner ID is the process instance ID.</li>
  		<li>INTERNAL_EVENT: this is used by signaling - publishing events
  			by an activity. The owner ID is the activity instance ID.</li>
  		<li>Others: used by designer, automated tester, process launcher, etc.</li>
   	</ul>
    Note for event that can recur, once it is consumed, the entry is removed from
    the database, hence there is not a status such as &ldquo;Consumed&rdquo; for it.</li>
  <li>Owner ID: The ID of the designated owner of the document.</li>
  <li>Process Instance ID: the ID of the process instance this document
  		is associated to, if that can be determined.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the command buttons on this screen to manually create, modify and delete
   the entries, although this functionality is provided only for recovering from bad system
   errors, and should be used with extreme caution.</p>

<h2>Managing Event Wait Instances</h2>
<p>The Event Wait Instances tab is used to manage entries in the database table 
EVENT_WAIT_INSTANCE.
The following picture shows the tab as seen in the classic Designer.</p>
<img src='images/eventmgr_eventwait.jpg'/>
<p>The descriptions of the columns are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create Time: the time when the entry is created.</li>
  <li>Event Name: the event name to wait for. It must exist
  	in  the EVENT_INSTANCE table.</li>
  <li>Activity Instance: the ID of the activity instance waiting for the event.</li>
  <li>Event Wait ID: the unintelligent ID of the row in the table.</li>
  <li>Completion Code: the default completion code when the activity
  		receives this event. It can be overridden programmatically
  		in the resume method of the activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the command buttons on this screen to manually create and delete
   the entries, although this functionality is provided only for recovering from bad system
   errors, and should be used with extreme caution.</p>
<p>To modify an entry, simply delete the entry and create a new one, because
  the event wait instance ID is not meaningful and does not need to be preserved.</p>

<h2>View Event Log</h2>
<p>The Event Log tab is used to view entries in the database table EVENT_LOG,
which contains information for auditing purposes.
The following picture shows the tab as seen in the classic Designer.</p>
<img src='images/eventmgr_eventlog.jpg'/>
<p>The descriptions of the columns are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create Time: the time when the entry is created (event occurs).</li>
  <li>Event Name: a descriptive name for the event.</li>
  <li>Event Log ID: the unintelligent ID of the entry.</li>
  <li>Category: AUDIT for user actions, EVENT_HISTORY for external
  		event registration and de-registration history, SCHEDULED_JOB_HISTORY
  		for one execution of a scheduled job, etc.</li>
  <li>Subcategory:</li>
  <li>Owner Type:</li>
  <li>Owner ID:</li>
  <li>Comment: </li>
  <li>User: CUID of the user making the change. If the event is a system one,
  		the system name is entered here.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not possible to make changes in this table,
as they represent audit data.</p>

<h2>Advanced Management</h2>
<p>The rest of this document covers database tables, backward compatibility,
design considerations, etc., and is considered for advanced users.</p>

<h3>Database Tables for Event Management</h3>
<p>The database table <code>EVENT_INSTANCE</code> is the primary table
for event management. The table is currently used to store the following
types of data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>External events: matching external events with activities that registered listening the events</li>
  <li>Scheduled jobs</li>
  <li>Internal events: messages between different threads/JVM, including following 3 types:
		<ul>
      	   <li>delayed message: consumeDate is not null, reference can be null or others, 
      		   	event name is often InternalEvent.<var>actInstId</var> when the event is for notifying an activity instance
				or InternalEvent.<var>procInstId</var>start<var>activityId</var> when the event is to start an activity instance</li>
		   <li>resume message due to connection pool down: 	consumerDate is null, reference is "pool:poolname", 
			   		event name is InternalEvent.<var>actInstId</var></li>
		   <li>active message: consumeDate is null, reference is "active"</li>
		</ul></li>
  <li>Flags</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The following lists all columns of the table:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><code>EVENT_NAME</code></td><td>The primary key</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>DOCUMENT_ID</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>STATUS_CD</code></td><td>
    This field is used for indicating which type of messages as well as sub classification of status within the type.
    The following is the list of all status code:
    <ul>
      <li>0 (external event - waiting): this is an external event, and an activity has registered to listen, but the event has not arrived yet.
      		We expect there is only one listener and the event can recur</li>
      <li>1 (external event - waiting by multiple activities): this is an external event, and at least one activity has registered to listen, but the event has not arrived yet.
      		We expect there can be multiple activities listening on it and the event cannot recur</li>
      <li>2 (external event - arrived): an external event has arrived, but no activity has registered as a listener.</li>
      <li>3 (external event - consumed): an external event has arrived, and at least one activity has registered for listening, so the
      		event has been consumed by at least one activity. Note that for recurring an external event,
      		as soon as the event is consumed, the entry is removed from the database, so there is no
      		corresponding status code, and this status code is only for non-recurring events that can expect multiple listeners</li>
      <li>4 (flag): a flag indicates something has happened. Set and clear by API only</li>
      <li>5 (scheduled job): was previously known as timer tasks.</li>
      <li>7 (internal event):</li>
    </ul>
	</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>CREATE_DT</code></td>
	<td>Create date of the event entry</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>CONSUME_DT</code></td>
	<td>For external events, this is use</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>PRESERVE_INTERVAL</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>AUXDATA</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>REFERENCE</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>COMMENTS</code></td><td></td></tr>
</table>
