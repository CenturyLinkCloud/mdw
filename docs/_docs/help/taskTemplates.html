<h1>Manual Task Templates</h1>

<p>MDW manual task activities use the task template concept to separate the definition of task characteristics from workflow.
The reason for this is to make it possible for folks who aren't workflow designers to own and change aspects of a task's definition
(such as SLA, notification options, routing setup, etc).</p>

<p>When you configure a manual task activity in MDW Studio, you'll associate the activity with a task template.
The task template is a JSON asset with a .task file extension that defines the behavior of task instances created according to that template.
</p>

<h3>Configuring a Task Template</h3>
<p>MDW provides two ways to configure the task templates: 1) in MDW Studio, and 2) in MDWHub.  The Designer mechanism is useful for workflow
developers who want to define the template while they're building up a flow.  The MDWHub page is for end-users such as workgroup managers.</p>

<strong>TODO:</strong> assemble the documentation on Task SLAs, Workgroups, Notices, Indexes, Autoform layout from the scattered HTML sources
into this page.  Also describe custom pages and link to the Custom Web documentation. 

<P>In your workflow you can also create custom web pages. To create the custom web page, follow <a href="customWeb.html">this link</a>.
