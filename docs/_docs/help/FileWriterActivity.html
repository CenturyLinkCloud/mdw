<h1>File Writer Activity</h1>

The MDW File Writer adapter activity provides the capability to write to a file on the server file system.
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Design Attributes</h3>
The basic design parameters for configuring a File Writer Activity are illustrated in the screenshot below.
<br/><br/>
The first attribute to specify is the path of the file to write to.
This value can reference a property or variable using MDW's <a href="bindingExpressions.html">Java EL Binding</a> syntax. 
<br/><br/>
The next attribute indicates whether to append to the file.  If append is not selected, the file will be overwritten with each subsequent activity execution.
<br/><br/>
In a real-world scenario, the Content String attribute will almost always be dynamic.
This can be accomplished through the use of an expression pointing to a process variable as illustrated in the screenshot.
If the variable is a document-type variable, it will be serialized to a string value using the appropriate translator.
<br/><br/>
If you need to perform some specialized output based on additional criteria, you can extend the FileWriterAdapter class and overwrite the getRequestData() method.
