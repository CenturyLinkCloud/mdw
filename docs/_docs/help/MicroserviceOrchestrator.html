<h1>Microservice Orchestrator</h1>

<p>The Microservice Orchestrator activity is at the heart of MDW's service orchestration capabilities.
It uses a declarative <a href="#servicePlan">Service Plan</a> to give you a flexible and expressive way to control 
which services are called invoked and exactly how they are invoked.  MDWHub provides a drillable, end-to-end 
runtime view enabling users to track all services and their dependencies.</p>

<h3><a id="servicePlan">Service Plan</a></h3>
<p>The best way to understand how to create a Service Plan to drive your Microservice Orchestrator activity is to look
at a working example.  The MDW automated tests include a straightforward example in the Microservice Orchestration process:</p> 
<img style="width:800px;border:1px solid black;" src="images/microserviceOrchestration.png" />
<p>Implementation for the Invoke Services activity starts upstream in the Create Plan 
<a href="https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/blob/master/mdw-workflow/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/kotlin/readme.md">Kotlin Script</a>
activity.  Here's the source code that populates the servicePlan variable according to runtime conditions:</p>
<pre>
variables["servicePlan"] = servicePlan(runtimeContext) {
    services {
        microservice {
            name = "admin/createUser"
            method = "POST"
            url = "${runtimeContext.props["mdw.services.url"]}/services/Users"
            bindings {
              "requestMapper" to "com.centurylink.mdw.tests.microservice/UserRequestMapper.groovy"
              "responseMapper" to "com.centurylink.mdw.microservice/StatusResponseMapper.groovy"
            }
        }
        microservice {
            name = "admin/createGroup"
            method = "POST"
            url = "${runtimeContext.props["mdw.services.url"]}/services/Workgroups"
            enabled = (variables["request"] as Jsonable).getJson().has("group")
            bindings {
              "requestMapper" to "com.centurylink.mdw.tests.microservice/GroupRequestMapper.groovy"
              "responseMapper" to "com.centurylink.mdw.microservice/StatusResponseMapper.groovy"
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The left side of the assignment on the first line is what sets the variable value.  The special <code>servicePlan()</code> constructor
uses a super friendly Kotlin DSL to specify which services are executed and with what values.  Each microservice represents a designated endpoint
that's to be run zero or more times based on its setup.  For example, the first <code>microservice</code> declaration says to POST to the createUser service
with a property-driven URL from <a href="https://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/guides/configuration/">mdw.yaml</a>.  Using Kotlin infix notation,
it also spells out any input <a href="bindingExpressions.html">variable bindings</a> to be passed to the invocation subflow.  Dynamic values for each 
microservice can be assigned using <code>variables["myvar"]</code> syntax, or Kotlin 
<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-types.html#string-templates">String Template</a> expressions.  At runtime, all these values
are substituted into the servicePlan YAML process variable.</p>

<p>There are many more options available for configuring each microservice than those depicted in this example.  The best documentation for these options 
is the <a href="https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/blob/master/mdw-workflow/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/microservice/ServicePlanModel.kt">ServicePlanModel.kt</a>
source code that contains all of the default values.</p>
<pre>
data class Microservice(
        private val runtimeContext: ActivityRuntimeContext = MockRuntimeContext("dummy"),
        var name: String = "",
        var url: String = "",
        var method: String = "",
        var subflow: String = "com.centurylink.mdw.microservice/\${StandardInvoke}.proc",
        var enabled: Boolean? = true,
        var count: Int = 1,
        var bindings: MutableMap<String,Any?> = mutableMapOf(
          "microservice" to name,
          "serviceUrl" to url,
          "serviceMethod" to method,
          "request" to runtimeContext.docRefs["request"],
          "requestHeaders" to runtimeContext.docRefs["requestHeaders"],
          "serviceSummary" to runtimeContext.docRefs["serviceSummary"],
          "requestMapper" to "com.centurylink.mdw.microservice/IdentityRequestMapper.groovy",
          "responseMapper" to "com.centurylink.mdw.microservice/IdentityResponseMapper.groovy"
    )
</pre>
<p>For example, notice in this source code that by default <code>enabled</code> is true and <code>count</code>
is one.  Either of these can be overridden by dynamic or conditional values based on process runtime state.</p>

<p>By far the most important microservice setting is its <code>subflow</code> property.  An essential aspect of microservice orchestration is that each
invocation spawns an individual subprocess suited to its specific endpoint.  Notice that the default value points to a prebuilt .proc asset from the 
com.centurylink.mdw.microservice package.  In fact, the $ prefix tells us that this is a <a href="#templateProcesses">Template Process</a>.
The ${StandardInvoke} process provides a sequence that should prove useful in many circumstances.  If ${StandardInvoke} does not meet your needs, you should
point to your own subflows, which may or may not be template processes.</p>

<p>Any number of <code>bindings</code> may be used to pass values to a subflow.  In ${StandardInvoke}, requestMapper and responseMapper variables are needed
to transform the main flow's <code>request</code> to the <code>serviceRequest</code> variable used by each subflow adapter.  This transformation is accomplished
in a <a href="crossmap.html">Crossmap</a> activity.  By default the identity request/response mappers are passed, indicating no translation required.</p>

<h3><a id="templateProcesses">Template Processes</a></h3>
<p>Template processes are effectively no different from regular processes, except that their runtime instances are labeled according to their microservice
name.  So in the example above all instances are defined by ${StandardInvoke}, but in MDWHub they appear as admin/createUser or admin/createGroup.
Technically that's the only difference between a template process and any other process.  However, by convention template processes have dynamic placeholders
in many places that ordinarily would be hard-wired.  For example, in ${StandardInvoke} the REST adapter activity defines its HTTP method as ${serviceMethod}
instead of selecting GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE from the dropdown.  Upstream, <code>serviceMethod</code> is bound to the servicePlan's "method" parameter.</p>  

<h3><a id="serviceSummary">Service Summary</a></h3>
<p>A big part of Microservice Orchestrator's value proposition is centered around the end-to-end Service Summary.  This gives you a lot of free goodies as long 
as your flow abides by the convention of declaring a Jsonable serviceSummary input variable in each subflow along the way.</p>

<p>For a working example, clone and run the <a href="https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo">mdw-demo</a> project which contains the microservice test 
flows.  Once you have mdw-demo running, submit a request like this one from the microservice test package:
<a href="https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo/blob/master/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/tests/microservice/mainRequest.json">
https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo/blob/master/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/tests/microservice/mainRequest.json</a>
Then, on the MDWHub Workflow tab, change the filter to include [Any] status and drill into the latest MicroserviceOrchestration instance.
You can look at the serviceSummary variable JSON for all the gory details, but the new Service Summary tab provides friendlier access.

<p>Here you can view the status of all invocations at a glance, or click to drill in to any specific instance.</p>
