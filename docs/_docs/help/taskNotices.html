<h1>Task Notices</h1>

Task notices provide the capability to automatically send templated e-mail notifications when a stage in the task instance lifecycle is reached.
You can configure task instance notices by adding the appropriate template name corresponding to the lifecycle outcome on the Notices tab of the Manual Task Activity properties.
The Notifier Classes column on this tab is populated by default with the MDW Framework implementation, which you may override if desired by specifying your own custom TemplatedNotifier implementation.
Multiple notifier classes may be registered by specifying a comma-delimited or #-delimited list.
It is recommended that rather than implementing TemplatedNotifier directly you extend the MDW class TaskEmailNotifier.
<br/>
<h3>E-Mail Templates</h3>
Templates for task lifecycle e-mails are the same as described in the general <a href="notification.html">Notification Activity</a> documentation.
Pre-built sample templates provided with the MDW baseline package include taskOpenEmail.html and taskOpenOneClick.html.

<br/><br/>
For simple HTML templates, the implicit model value represents the TaskRuntimeContext object, whose getters can be accessed as in the following examples:
<ul>
	<li><b> #{context.variables['xmlBeanVar']['/ser:ActionRequest/Action/Parameter[1]']}</b></li>
	<li><b>#{variables['xmlBeanVar']['/ser:ActionRequest/Action/Parameter[2]']}</b></li>
	<li><b> #{context.taskInstanceVO.taskName}</b></li>
	<li><b>#{masterRequestId}</b></li>
	<li><b>#{mdwWebUrl}</b></li><li><b>#{mdwTaskManagerUrl}</b></li>
	<li><b>#{mdwDesignerUrl}</b></li><li><b>#{mdwDesignerRcpUrl}</b></li>
	<li><b>#{processInstanceId}</b></li><li><b> #{processName}</b></li>
	<li><b>#{customerName}</b></li><li><b>#{taskInstanceId}</b></li>
	<li><b>#{taskName}</b></li><li><b>#{dueDate}</b></li><li><b>#{orderId}</b></li>
	<li><b>#{taskInstanceUrl}</b></li><li><b>#{taskClaimUserCuid}</b><br></li>
</ul>
For Facelet templates, the implicit managed bean is a named TaskRuntimeContext object, which can be accessed as in the following examples:
<ul>
  	<li><b>#{context.masterRequestId} </b> -- the value of masterRequestId</li>
	<li><b> #{context.variables.activityName}</b> -- the value of Notification activity name</li>
	<li><b>#{context.taskId}</b> -- the value of taskId</li> 	
	<li><b>#{context.variables.customerName}</b> -- the value of the process variable named 'customerName'</li>
</ul><b>
You can insert images into your e-mail body in the same manner as for general notification activities.
</b>
<br/><br/>
<h3>Recipients</h3>
By default notices are sent to users who belong the workgroups associated with the task (except assignment notices which are sent only to the task assignee).
Alternatively recipients can be overridden and configured the same way as described in the general <a href="notification.html">Notification Activity</a> docs.
To enable this capability in MDW Designer, from the menu select Window > Preferences > MDW > Process Design > "Allow Override of Task Notice Recipients".

<h3>Lifecycle Outcomes</h3>
A notifier may be invoked when the following lifecycle transitions occur for a task instance.
See the documentation topic <a href="taskAction.html">Task Actions</a> for an explanation of the actions which may trigger these transitions.
<br/><br/>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Open</th>
    <td>Task instance is newly-created or becomes unassigned</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Assigned</th>
    <td>Task instance has been claimed or assigned to someone</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Failed</th>
    <td>Task instance has been failed due to a user performing the Abort action</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Completed</th>
    <td>Task instance has been completed by a user performing the Complete action or a custom action</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Cancelled</th>
    <td>Task instance has been cancelled by a user</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>In Progress</th>
    <td>Task instance has been flagged as being worked by a user</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Alert</th>
    <td>Task instance is approaching its scheduled Due Date without having been completed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Jeopardy</th>
    <td>Task instance has passed its scheduled Due Date without having been completed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Hold</th>
    <td>Task instance has been placed on hold</td>
  </tr>
</table>
