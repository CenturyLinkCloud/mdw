<h1>Using TimerWaitActivity</h1>

This implementor allows to put the process on pause for certain
period of time, and is referred to as Timer activity.
<p>
The activity takes two common attributes, "Amount", which
specifies the number of units to wait (the internal attribute
name is indeed "TIMER_WAIT")
and "Unit" for the wait amount (Seconds, Minutes, or Hours, and
default to Minutes).
<p>
This attribute can also take a <a href="bindingExpressions.html">binding expression</a> instead of a fixed
number. For example, you can specify "<code>$myvar</code>", which is a variable
that is supposed to contain an integer value indicating the number
of minutes to wait. You can use either Java code or script language
to calculate the value dynamically.
<p>
Alternatively, you can subclass this implementor 
and override the method <code>int getWaitPeriodInSeconds()</code>
to achieve the desired customization. If you do go this way,
you may need to customize the implementor descriptor in the designer
so that the two attributes are not shown.
<p>
To wait for a particular date and time, you can calculate the
number of minutes from the time the activity is invoked to
the desired date and time.
<p>
Note that in the case when you do not need to wait, rather than returning
0 or negative numbers in <code>getWaitPeriodInSeconds()</code>, you should
return <code>DEFAULT_WAIT</code>, which is defined as 30 (seconds). The reason
for this is to avoid race condition, as returning 0 will immediately trigger
a JMS message to resume the activity instance.

<h3>Notes About Timeouts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The mdw.timer.ThresholdForDelay setting (in minutes, with a default of 60) controls whether JMS or DB is used for storing timeouts (values below the threshold use JMS; those above use DB).</li>
  <li>In ServiceMix, JMS timeouts require "scheduleSupport" in localhost-broker.xml and may not be preserved across a server shutdown.</li>
  <li>The MDW scheduled event monitor runs at a frequency specified by mdw.timer.CheckInterval (in seconds with a default of 60), and with an initial startup delay of mdw.timer.InitialDelay (in seconds with a default value of 300).  So this means that db timeouts cannot be expected to be more accurate +/- 1 minute.  It also means that when the server is initially started the check will not be performed for at least 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>It is highly recommended that the value of ThresholdForDelay NOT be set below 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>During testing, you may desire shorter timeouts than those expected in real-world scenarios.  In that case, it's important that you understand that the delays may not be accurate down to the minute if they're stored in the db.</li>
  <li>Also, you should understand that if the delay is stored in JMS then it can be lost after a server shutdown.  Furthermore, if your scenario calls for the timeout to be rescheduled, this can only be accommodated in the database as JMS timeouts cannot be changed once established.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wait For Unsolicited Events</h2>
It is often desired that when a process is waiting
for a particular time to arrive, it needs to handle
unsolicited external events such as receiving a supplemental
order or cancellation of the request.
The activity allows to optionally register for listening
to unsolicited events before the timer expires.
It uses the same mechanism as <code>EventWaitActivity</code> to register
the event waits (following <a href="EventWaitActivity.html">this link</a>
for details of event wait registration and additional details).
<p>
When the activity instance receives an event before the timer expires,
it can be left in one of the 3 statuses:

<ul>
  <li>Canceled. The activity instance will be canceled.</li>
  <li>Hold. The activity instance will be put on a hold status (showing cyan color
  		in the designer's process instance view). While the activity instance in hold status,
  		timer expiration will be ignored. When the
  		activity is put back on waiting status (see <a href="EventWaitActivity.html">this link</a>
  		for discussion on how this can happen), if the timer is already expired, or
  		another event it is waiting for has been received,
  		the activity instance will process that.</li>
  <li>Waiting. The activity instance continues waiting (i.e. still actively responds
      to timer expiration as well as other unsolicited events).</li>
</ul>

We note that the activity can only listen to recurring events. This limitation
is needed to avoid infinite looping when the activity instances resume
waiting from hold status, non-recurring events that have already arrived
would always trigger a transition.
<p>
To provide custom code handling unsolicited events, you will need to override 
<code>processOtherMessage(String message)</code>. 
The method is passed in with one argument, which is the entire message. The default
method does nothing. The completion code after processing the message is configured
in the designer, but you can override it in the code by invoking <code>setReturnCode()</code>.
<p>
<font color='red'><b>A word of caution</b></font>: the wait is implemented
via delayed JMS resume messages, so it depends on the persistence of 
JMS message store provided by the container. In current ECOM practice,
a new WLS domain is created for every new release, so the deployment
process needs to include a step to copy JMS file store from the old
domain to the new domain.

<h2>Advanced Usage</h2>
The activity allows to wait for additional periods upon
timer expiration through customization and this feature
can be used to implement a polling pattern - the activity
periodically invokes custom code to determine if further wait
is needed. This functionality is used to replace work transition
validator concept in MDW 3.*.
<p>
We must emphasize that this feature is not recommended, due to the fact
that polling may take a lot more CPU resources. The recommended
approach is to use the event wait activity.
<p>
There are two ways to use these feature. The first way is very similar
to that of work transition validator in MDW 3.*.
You specify a custom validator in the attribute <code>Custom Validator</code>,
which must be a class name. That class must implement the interface
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.work.transition.validation.WorkTransitionValidator</code>
(the name is kept for backward compatibility reasons).
The class must implement 3 methods of the interface:
<ul>
  <li><code>void prepare(Long activityId, Long processInstanceId, String eventType,
                VariableInstanceInfo[] variableInstances)</code>: this is invoked
      by the engine when the timer expires (first and later times) to initialize
      the custom validator. The <code>eventType</code> parameter is always passed in
      as null. </li>
  <li><code>boolean canWorkTransitionNow()</code>: this methods must return true
      if we finish waiting and needs to move on to next activity based on
      process definition, and it must return false if we need to wait further.
      The amount of time to wait further is determined by the next method.</li>
  <li><code>Integer getRevalidationIntervalInMin()</code>: in case further
      wait is needed, this method needs to return the time span (in minutes)
      of the new waiting period. Note the initial wait period is not determined
      by this method, rather by the common attributes discussed above.</li>
</ul>
The second and perhaps more preferred method is to subclass this activity
and override the method <code>boolean processTimerExpiration()</code>.
Your method needs to return true when no more wait is needed,
and must invoke <code>void sendDelayedResumeMessage(int seconds)</code>
and return false when further delay is needed.
The following is a sample implementation of the method.
<pre>
     protected boolean processTimerExpiration() 
         throws ActivityException
     {
         // determine number of seconds to wait further
         // a 0 or negative number indicates no further wait is needed
         int seconds = customLogicToDetermineHowLongToWait();
         if (seconds>0) {
             logger.info("Wait for additional " + seconds + " seconds");
             sendDelayedResumeMessage(seconds);
             return false;
         } else return true;
     }
</pre>
