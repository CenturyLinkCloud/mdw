<h1>Using Adapter Connection Pool</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

MDW provides out-of-box adapter activities for many protocols
such as JMS, Tibco Bus, MDW Web Service and MQ Series. It is very simple
to use them directly or extend them to implement your own adapters.
<p>
This simplicity, while allowing rapid learning and prototype, often lacks
manageability needed in a production environment. The connection
pool mechanism, while slighly more complicated, adds the following 
features for supporting production environments:
<ul>
  <li>Throttling control: connection pools allow to specify maximum 
      number of simultaneous connections.</li>
  <li>Certified delivery: connection pools can automatically re-send
  	  messages on connection failures. You can configure how many 
  	  and how often the retries are to be made. When maximum number
  	  of retries are reached, an exception is thrown back to the invoker
  	  when it is synchronous, or a Sentry marker is logged to generate
  	  alarms when it is asynchronous.
  <li>A management user interface is provided to manually re-send messages
      after all automatic retries fail, among other management functionalities.</li>
  <li>Switching to a different transport technology is easier (configuration
      change that can even be done in the management user interface at run time).</li>
</ul>
The connection pool mechanism involves the following components:
<ul>
  <li>Connection pools: each connection pool manages 1 or more connections to 
  	  one or a group of communication end points.</li>
  <li>Poolable adapters: a <dfn>poolable adapter</dfn> is an adapter activity
  	  implemented by extending the new base class, <code>PoolableAdapterBase</code>,
  	  introduced in MDW 4.5.12 and 5.1.05. See <a href='AdapterActivityBase.html'>
  	  Using Adapter Activities</a> for more details. Each connection
  	  managed by a connection pool is an instance of a poolable adapter.</li>
  <li>Connection pool adapter: this is an adapter activity interfacing with a connection pool
  	  (instead of directly to communication end points as other adapter activities,
  	  which are called <dfn>direct connection adapter activities</dfn> to differentiate
  	  from pooled connection adapters).</li>
  <li>Certified message manager: it exists independently from connection pool mechanism,
      but it is more general when working together with connection pools.</li>
  <li>Connection pool management GUI: this will be provided in MDW Web Tool and classic designer
      (not completed yet as of this writing).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The tasks by an MDW application to use the connection pool mechanism include
the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implementation of a poolable adapter, unless one provided
      by MDW out-of-box can be used (as of this writing, MDW 4.5.12 and
      5.1.05 provide the following out-of-box poolable adapters:
      Tibco BUS, MDW WebService, Email, and MQ Series.</li>
  <li>Configuration of a connection pool (as properties or through the management GUI).</li>
  <li>Optionally, extend the out-of-box connection pool adapter activity
      to handle external system specific custom logic.</li>
  <li>Configuration of a connection pool adapter activity (in Designer).</li>
</ul>

A connection pool typically supports one of the following two connection styles:
<ul>
<li>One-connection-for-all: with this style, when a connection (an instance
   of a poolable adapter) is started in the pool, the connection 
   establishes a communication channel (a generic term describing
   transport protocol-specific linkage, such as a web service port)
   with the end-point when it is initialized, and will not release the channel
   until the pool decides to destroy the connection.</li>
<li>One-connection-per-call: with this style, a communication channel with the end-point
   is established when the connection is activated (borrowed by a client)
   and the channel is released immediately after each use (when the connection 
   is returned to the pool).</li>
</ul>

A connection pool can support one or more of the following three messaging styles:
<ul>
   <li>Synchronous: the client is waiting for a response of a request message. 
   			This is also known as request-reply style.</li>
   <li>Asynchronous: the client sends message but does not expects or waits for responses.</li>
   <li>Certified: same as asynchronous in that the client does not expects or waits for responses,
   			but it expects the message to be retried automatically when the message delivery fails
   			when the destination system does not respond.</li>
</ul>
Introduction to certified messages is covered
under <a href="JmsAdapter.html">JMS Adapter documentation</a>,
as JMS is the preferred way of using certified messages.
Certified messages require hand-shaking between the sender and receiver to
ensure the messages are acknowledged and delivered exactly once,
and such hand-shaking is implemented for JMS messages when both the sender and
the receiver are MDW applications (4.5 for MDW 4 and 5.1 for MDW 5).
<p>
When the receiver is not an MDW application, it is not possible to implement
a general certified mechanism. 
With the help of a little bit of custom coding (in adapters),
the connection pools can be used for the next best thing - it can ensure the messages are delivered
by automatic retrying, but it cannot ensure the messages
are delivered no more than once. In practice, this is sufficient
in most of time, especially that it does not require receiver to be MDW-based applications.

<h2>Connection Pool Configuration</h2>
Connection pools are configured through properties and will also be
possible to be configured in the connection pool management GUI.
<p>
The configuration of each connection pool involves defining a set of 
properties, some of these are common to all conection pools and 
others are specific to adapters used by the pools.
All property names for a connection pool have the same prefix, 
in the form of <code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var></code>.
The following table shows the common properties.
<table>
<tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.Adapter</code></td><td>
    Java class name of a poolable adapter activity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.OneConnectionForAll</code></td><td>
    when it has value <code>true</code>, the connection pool uses
    one-connection-for-all style. When it is not specified or the value is not <code>true</code>,
    the one-connection-per-call style is used.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.PoolSize</code></td><td>Maximum number of connections
    allowed in the pool. This is an optional attribute, and the default pool size is one.
    Note in a clustered environment, each managed server has a connection pool, and
    the size applies to each server (the total number of connections is
    therefore the number of servers times the value of this attribute).</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.timeout</code></td><td>
	For synchronous (request-reply) and certified messages, the timeout in seconds waiting for
	 response or acknowledgment.  This is optional and the default value is 120 for response of synchronous
	 messages and 15 seconds for acknowledgment of certified messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.max_tries</code></td><td>Maximum number of attempts
    (tries and retries). This is an optional attribute, and the default value is 12.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.retry_interval</code></td><td>The number of seconds
    between retries. This is an optional attribute, and the default value is 600 (10 minutes). This value
    is the lower bound and the actual retry interval can be longer.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.enabled</code></td><td>Indicate whether
	the connection pool is enabled (with value "true") or not (with value "false"). The default is enabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.auto_shutdown_threshold</code></td><td>If this property is set and is a number
    greater than 0, then the pool will automatically shut down after that number
    of consecutive connection failures. In a clustered environment, failures are
    counted cluster-wise, and the pools of all servers will be shut down.
    Any successful connection (a connection request
    that does not throw <code>ConnectioException</code>) will reset the counter
    to 0. Note auto-shutdown does not change the property <code>enabled</code> to false,
    so when a server is restarted, the pool is started again for the server.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.ping_interval</code></td><td>When auto-shutdown
    is turned on (auto_shutdown_threshold>0), you can also set this attribute
    (number of seconds) so that the pool will keep pinging the end point
    with this interval. Actual message for pinging must be implemented
    in the adapter used by the connection pool. If a ping returns successful,
    the pools of all managed servers will be restarted automatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.PingTimeout</code></td><td>
    The time out in seconds for pinging. If the attribute is not specified,
    the value for the property <code>timeout</code> is used.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
As of this writing (MDW 4.5.12 and MDW 5.1.05), 4 poolable adapters are provided out-of-box.
Their specific properties are described below.

<h3>Poolable Tibco Bus Adapter</h3>
This adapter provides capability of sending messages through Tibco Bus. It supports 
synchronous/certified messages. Note that this implementation uses
Tibco native request-reply messaging for both synchronous and certified messages, not using
native Tibco-implemented certified messages (which are discouraged by CenturyLink bus infrastructure due to
its overhead).
The implementation class is <code>com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.adapter.tibco.PoolableTibcoBusAdapter</code>. 
The following table lists additional configuration properties used by the adapter.
   <table>
   	 <tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
   	 <tr><td>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.uri</td>
   	 		<td>The bus URI, such as <code>rvd://239.75.2.3:7523/denvzd.qwest.net:7523</code>. There is
   	 		no default value for this and the property is required.</td></tr>
   	 <tr><td>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.topic</td>
   	 		<td>The bus top name. This is required.</td></tr>
   	 <tr><td>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.account</td>
   	 		<td>The application's account name. Default is <code>MDW</code></td></tr>
   	 <tr><td>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.credential</td>
   	 		<td>Default is empty string</td></tr>   	 		
   </table>
Additionally, meta data can be specified (used in sending messages) through the 
(connection pool or direct connection) adapter activities,
and they are added as meta information to Bus Connector messages.

<h3>Poolable MDW Web Service Adapter</h3>
This adapter provides capability of invoking MDW Web Services.
It supports synchronous/certified messages.  
The implementation class is <code>com.centurylink.mdw.activity.workflow.activity.impl.PoolableMdwWebServiceAdapter</code>. 
The following table lists additional configuration properties used by the adapter.
   <table>
   	 <tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
   	 <tr><td>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.wsdl</td>
   	 		<td>The WSDL URL. Required</td></tr> 	 		
   </table>

<h3>MQ Series Adapter</h3>
This adapter provides capability of sending messages through MQ Series.
It supports asynchronous/certified messages as well as synchronous ones (implemented
by waiting responses on dynamic queues).  
The implementation class is <code>com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.adapter.mqseries.MqSeriesAdapter</code>. 
The following table lists additional configuration properties used by the adapter.
   <table>
   	 <tr><th>Property Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
   	 <tr><td>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.QueueManagerName</td>
   	 		<td>The local queue manager name</td></tr>
   	<tr><td>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.QueueName</td>
   	 		<td>The queue name to which the messages are sent to</td></tr> 	 		
    <tr><td>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.ReplyQueueName</td>
   	 		<td>When in synchronous mode, this is used to specify the name
   	 		of the queue for receiving responses. It is typical to specify
   	 		a modal queue name here, so that the responses will be received
   	 		from dynamic queues. If this property is absent, it assumes
   	 		the existence of a model queue named <code>REPLY_MODEL_QUEUE</code>.</td></tr>
   </table>
Additionally, the property <code>CorrelationId</code> can be specified
as meta data (used in sending messages) through the adapter activities.
   
<h2>Configuration of the Connection Pool Adapter</h2>
The class <code>com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.adapter.ConnectionPoolAdapter</code>
implements an adapter activity that access a connection pool.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
The following attributes are used by this implementor:

<ul>
  <li>Request Variable. This is a variable name. The request message sent to external
      system is taken from the value of this variable.</li>
  <li>Response Variable. This is a variable name that will receive the response message,
      when the adapter is synchronous (Wait for response is true). It is ignored when
      the adapter is asynchronous or certified</li>
  <li>Log req/resp. This is a Boolean flag to turn on or off logging of messages
  	  to and from the external systems. The messages are logged in the database table
  	  in ADAPTER_INSTANCE (for MDW 4.*) or DOCUMENT table (for MDW 5.*). 
  	  </li>
  <li>Wait for response. When it is true, the messaging is in synchronous style, meaning it is waiting
      for a response; when it is false, the messaging is asynchronous, meaning the activity sends the message
      and moves on to the next activity. The third option is certified messaging.
      </li>
  <li>Connection Pool. This attribute specifies the name of the connection pool. The connection
  		pool must support the messaging style specified above.</li>
  <li>Time out (seconds). This specifies the timeout value for synchronous and
  		certified messages (ignored for asynchronous messages). If this is left blank,
  		then the time out property configured with the connection pool is used.
  		If property is not defined by the pool either, 120 seconds is used as the 
  		time out for synchronous messages, and for certified messages,
  		the acknowledgment timeout for certified messages is used (15 seconds
  		default and can be altered by the property <code>mdw.certified_message.AcknowlegmentTimeout</code>).
  </li>
  <li>Max tries. This specifies the maximum number of retries (including the
  		the very first attempt) for synchronous and
  		certified messages (ignored for asynchronous messages). If this is left blank,
  		then the max tries property configured with the connection pool is used.
		If property is not defined by the pool either, the default value of 12
		is used. For certified messages, this default can be altered
		by the property <code>mdw.certified_message.MaxTries</code>.
  		</li>
  <li>Retry interval (seconds). This specifies the elapse time between retries
        for synchronous and certified messages (ignored for asynchronous messages). If this is left blank,
  		then the retry interval property configured with the connection pool is used.
  		If property is not defined by the pool either, the default value of 600 seconds
		is used. For certified messages, this default can be altered
		by the property <code>mdw.certified_message.RetryInterval</code>.</li>
  <li>Request Message XSD. This is for documentation purpose only. If a valid URL is specified,
      you can open the XSD directly from the designer by clicking the "Open Link" button 
      on the right side of the attribute specification.</li>
  <li>Response Message XSD. This is for documentation purpose only. If a valid URL is specified,
      you can open the XSD directly from the designer by clicking the "Open Link" button 
      on the right side of the attribute specification.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Extending the Implementor</h3>
If your customization needs cannot be completely met by 
the attributes above, you can consider subclassing this implementor.
You can override the following methods:
<ul>
   <li><code>String getRequestData()</code>: this is invoked to obtain request message.
   </li>
   <li><code>onSuccess(String response)</code>: this is invoked when calls to the connection
   		pool is successful (no exception is thrown). As we explained elsewhere, 
   		the external system may return a response that indicates a retriable 
   		error, in which case you need to detect the condition here
   		and throw a ConnectionException for retries. In many cases it may be preferrable
   		to perform such detection in invoke() method, as the logic
   		is also used when the adapter is invoked in a connection pool.
   </li>
   <li><code>String onFailure(Throwable errorCause)</code>:
   		this is invoked when the calls to the connection pool throw exception.
   		The outcome of the method must be one of the following:
   		<ol>
   		   <li>throw ConnectionException. The engine will put the activity in error status,
			and schedule automatically retry of the activity.</li>
		   <li>throw AdapterException. The engine will put the activity in error status,
			and transition based on ERROR event (typically lead to exception handler)</li>
	 	   <li>return a completion code w/o throwing exception. The engine will complete
	 		the activity and transition accordingly</li>
   		</ol>
	 	The default implementation does the the following
	 	<ul>
	 		<li>if errorCause is an AdapterException, throws it.</li>
	 		<li>if errorCause is a ConnectionException, throws it.</li>
	 		<li>in any other case, throw an AdapterException 
	 			wrapping the original exception as its cause.</li>
		</ul>
		If you override this method, you typically should re-throw ConnectionException,
	 	so that the internal retry mechanism will not be impacted. More specifically,
	    the following are some special scenarios that you may need to know:
		<ul>
			<li>If the maximum number of retries has been reached, 
			errorCause is an AdapterException with error code 
			AdapterException.EXCEED_MAXTRIES. Original ConnectionException is wrapped
			as its cause. If you do not want to put the activity in error status and invoke exception handler,
	 		rather would like to handle the logic within process definition, then return
	 		a completion code without re-throwing the exception.</li>
			<li>If the activity is a ConnectionPoolAdapter and
	 		all connections are used in a connection pool, errorCause is a ConnectionException
	 		with error code ConnectionException.POOL_EXHAUSTED. You typically should just
	 		re-throw this exception so the engine will put activity in waiting status
	 		and will resume after a connection becomes available.</li>
	 		<li>If the activity is a ConnectionPoolAdapter and the connection pool is disabled 
	 		(manually or automatically shut down), errorCause is a ConnectionException
	 		with error code ConnectionException.POOL_DISABLED. You typically should just
	 		re-throw this exception so the engine will put activity in waiting status,
	 		and will resume after the pool is enabled.</li>
	 	</ul>
   </li>
   <li><code>String invoke(Object connection, String requestData, int timeout,
    Map&lt;String,String> metainfo)</code>: this is the main method for sending messages
    and receiving responses.</li>
    <li><code>Map<String,String> getMetaData()</code>: this is invoked to populate
    	meta data.</li>
</ul>
Refer to the <a href='AdapterActivityBase.html'>Using Activity Implementors</a> for more details.


<h2>Implementing Poolable Adapters</h2>


<p>A poolable adapter is an adapter activity extending the 
class  <code>com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.adapter.PoolableAdapterBase</code>.
Its instances are used as connections managed by connection pools.
A connection pool maintains
one or more connections, and its clients borrow connections from the pool when
there are available ones, and return them to the pool when they are done. If all
connections of the pool are borrowed, any additional request for borrowing connections
will be blocked until one is freed by other clients.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href='AdapterActivityBase.html'>Using Adapter Activities</a>
for implementing and customizing poolable adapters.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Topics</h2>
<h3>Connection Pool Administration Tool</h3>
The classic designer has a connection pool manager that 
can be used to configure connection pools at run time, and it can
also be used to enable/disable connection pools and perform
other administrative functions. 
The tool can be accessed from the Help menu, Connection Pool Manager item.
<p>
Connection pool configuration changes done through the tool can take effect
after you shutdown and restart the pool. Therefore, you can use
this feature to perform tuning in production environments (e.g. changing
connection pool size, setting auto shut down threshold, etc).

<h3>Scheduled up and down time</h3>
If the external system has a down-time window, we can schedule the connection
pool to start up and shutdown accordingly. Messages sent during down time
will be all delivered when the pool is started again.
<p>
To schedule up and down time, you will need to configure two timer tasks
(one for starting up and one for shutting down). The <code>run()</code>
method of the start up timer
task should look like
<pre>
public void run() {
    String poolName = <var>connection pool name</var>;
    AdapterConnectionPool pool = ConnectionPoolRegistration.getPool(poolName);
    pool.setEnabled(true);
}
</pre>
And the shutdown task should be identical
except the argument to <code>setEnabled</code> is false.

<h3>Auto-resend when enabling the connection pool</h3>
Certified messages and messages sent from a connection pool adapter
activity to a connection pool when it is disabled will
automatically be retried when the pool is enabled.
<p>
For certified messages that are sent while the pool is down,
you can view them in the Certified Message tab of the Designer's Event
Manager. They are shown as in active status (Certified Message),
but the next retry time should be blank.
<p>
For request messages sent from a connection pool adapter activity,
you can view them in the Internal Message tab of the Designer's Event
Manager. They are shown as messages with blank delivery time.
This internal message is for starting the activity again (retrying).

<h3>Auto Shut-down and Restart</h3>
<p>You can configure a connection pool so that it is automatically
shut down when it encounters a configurable threshold
number of consecutive connection failures.
The property name is <code>auto_shutdown_threshold</code> which takes
an integer value, and it takes effect only when the value is greater than 0.
The connection pool counts the number of consecutive <code>
ConnectionException</code> with error code <code>ConnectionException.CONNECTION_DOWN</code>
(41290, which is the default), and shuts down
when the threshold is reached.</p>
<p>In a clustered environment, the counting is cluster-wise, and the connection
pool on every server will shut down.</p>
<p>If you configure auto shut-down, you can also configure auto restart
by setting the property <code>ping_interval</code>, which is a number
representing the number of seconds between pinging to the external systems.
Note the adapter must implement the method <code>ping()</code> for this 
to work. In a clustered environment, only one ping message is sent
after each interval from one managed server (there is no guarantee
that two ping messages are issued from the same server).</p>
<p>We note that auto-shutdown and restart is different from manual shutdown/start:
the latter persists the status change by modifying the property <code>enabled</code> 
whereas the former only changes the status in memory.
Therefore, pools shut down automatically will be restarted
after the server is restarted, but not so for manual shutdowns.
Manually shut down pools can only be restarted manually, or by
manually modifying the property 
<code>mdw.connection.pool.<var>pool-name</var>.enabled</code> in the database
to <code>true</code> and restart the servers.</p>
