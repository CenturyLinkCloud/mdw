title: MDW Cookbook
---

Let's walk through the essential features of MDW.  All the source code we'll create in this guide
is available to clone in its completed state from the [mdw-demo repository](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo).  

### Setup
  - **Get MDW**  
    The easy way to run MDW locally is by following the [5-minute quick-start](../../getting-started/quick-start).
  - **Install the Designer plugin**  
    Assets can be created and edited in MDWHub, but for serious development you'll want to [install the Eclipse plugin](../../getting-started/install-designer).

### Steps in this Guide
  MDW is a workflow framework specializing in [microservice orchestration](../../presentations/microservices).
  This guide focuses on these aspects, with additional emphasis on manual task handling and MDWHub UI customization.
  For our use case we'll create a bug management workflow. 
  1. [Create a service process](#1-create-a-service-process)
  2. [Run the process and view its instances](#2-run-the-process-and-view-its-instances)
  3. [Expose the process as a REST service](#3-expose-the-process-as-a-rest-service)
  4. [Document the service API using Swagger](#4-document-the-service-api-using-swagger)
  
### 1. Create a service process
  If you haven't already, import the project generated by the CLI as described in the quick-start guide:
  - From the Eclipse File menu select > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspaces.  Then browse for your project directory.
  - Switch to the MDW Designer Perspective (Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Other > MDW Designer).  If you don't see your
    project, try clicking the Refresh toolbar icon ![refresh](../images/refresh.gif) at the top of Process Explorer view.

#### Create a package  
  Everything in MDW is what we call an [Asset](http://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/help/assets.html), and these live in packages, 
  similar to Java packages except that they contain a whole lot more than .java source files.  Let's create a package for our
  bug handling workflow:
  - Expand your project tree in Process Explorer.  You'll see the mdw6 baseline packages imported by the CLI during `mdw init` or `mdw update`.
    The default package set is pretty scant, but MDW includes quite a few optional packages; some of which we'll cover later.
  - Right-click on your project in Process Explorer and select New > MDW Package.  Name the package "com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs".
    Don't select any Workgroup for now, as this would restrict visibility of your new package.
    ![create package](../images/create-pkg.png)
  
#### Create a process  
  - Right-click on the bugs package and select New > MDW Process.  Name the process "Create Bug".<br>
    ![create process](../images/create-proc.png)
  
    Finally we can start building.
  
  - Double-click the process title in the Designer canvas.  Look at the Properties view at the bottom of the Eclipse window, 
    and you'll observe that the associated property tab gained focus.  Property tabs are how design elements are configured.
  - Select the Design tab for the process and check the Service Process checkbox.  This tells MDW that this process is expected to run 
    synchronously and return a response in real time.
  
#### Add some process variables
  - Now click on the Variables property tab.  To start with, add a string input variable that'll hold the bug's title.  Name the variable 'bugTitle',
    and make sure its Mode is Input.  To hold the retrieved commit info, add another string variable named 'response' with mode Output.
    Here's what the Variables property tab should look like when you're finished:
    ![add variables](../images/add-vars.png)

#### Add a script activity
  The Designer Toolbox view contains the available activities for building our process.  In MDW, an *activity* is an individual step in a workflow,
  and an *activity implementor* is a Java class that defines an activity's behavior.  MDW comes with a boatload of [prebuilt activities](../../development/built-in-activities).
  Quite possibly you'll want to extend the toolbox with your own custom activities.  We'll cover that in another section of the cookbook.
  
  - In the Toolbox view locate the activity labeled "Execute Script" and drag it onto the Designer canvas.  Double-click the activity in the canvas,
    and select its Definition property tab.  Change the label from "New Execute Script" to "Validate Request".  Click any blank spot on the canvas to preview this label change.
    
  - Double-click the activity again and select its Script tab. Make sure the language is Groovy, and then click the Edit Script link.
    This opens an Eclipse editor.  Write a script to confirm that the bug title contains less than 512 characters:
    ```groovy
    if (bugTitle.length() > 512)
        response = 'invalid'
    else
        response = 'accepted'    
    ```
    Notice how this script has implicit access to the `bugTitle` and `response` variables, for both reading and assigning.
    
  - Save the script editor contents in Eclipse by selecting File > Save from the menu (or by clicking the disk icon in the Eclipse toolbar, or by typing ctrl-s).
    You'll be reminded via a warning dialog that the script content goes with the process, and therefore the process must be saved as well.
    We'll save the process in a minute. 
    
  - Now to integrate the script activity into our workflow.  Switch back to the 'Create Bug' process editor again in Designer.
    Select the link (or *transition* in MDW-speak) connecting the Start and Stop activities, and hit Delete.
    Drag the Validate Request activity between Start and Stop.  Next comes the trickiest part of mastering Designer.  We use the so-called "shift-click-drag" mechanism for linking activities on the canvas.
    
  - Hold down the Shift key on your keyboard, click on the upstream activity, and continue holding down the mouse left click button while dragging the cursor 
    to the downstream activity (shift-click-drag).  Repeat this technique to draw links so that your process looks like this:   
    ![script activity](../images/script-activity.png)
    
  - Save your process.  Elect to "Overwrite current version" and to "Remember this selection for future saves". 
    In shared environments MDW needs to support multiple asset versions simultaneously, but for convenience locally you'll mostly overwrite existing versions.  


### 2. Run the process and view its instances
  For testing and refining your process, it's convenient to run it from Designer.  When a process is executed MDW creates an *instance* which contains
  distinct runtime values.  Unlike definition artifacts which are maintained in Git, instance data is stored in a database.  The quick-start mechanism
  employs an [Embedded DB](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/blob/master/mdw-workflow/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/db/readme.md), 
  so when your server's running the database is automatically online.
  
#### Run the process from Designer
  - If your MDW server is not running already, open a command window in your project directory and type `mdw run`.
  
  - Right-click on the Create Bug process in Process Explorer and select Run.  This opens the Eclipse launch configuration dialog.  Click on the Variables
    tab and double-click the Value cell for the bugTitle input variable.  Enter something for the bug title.
    
    ![set variables](../images/set-vars.png)
    
  - Click the Run button to execute your process.
  
#### View the process instance in Designer
  - Right click on Create Bug in Process Explorer and select View Instances.  The Process Instances tab appears, showing a table with the last-run
    instance at the top.  Double-click the instance.  The instance runtime view opens up in the Designer canvas, and in place of the Toolbox the Activity Status
    Legend appears.
    
  - Double-click on the process title or a blank place in the runtime view. Property tabs for an instance contain runtime data for that instance.
    Select the values tab to see the variable values for this instance:
    ![designer process instance](../images/proc-inst-designer.png)

#### View the same instance in MDWHub
  - Fire up your browser and navigate to MDWHub: <http://localhost:8080/mdw>.  Click the Filter button, and in the Status dropdown select Completed.
    Click the Create Bug link for your instance.
    
  - Click the process title or a blank place in the MDWHub runtime view.  The Inspector pane appears.  Click the Values tab in Inspector to view
    variable values:
    ![hub process instance](../images/proc-inst-hub.png)
    
  - To see how a process definition looks in MDWHub, click on the Definition Nav link for the instance.  Click a blank spot in the canvas to view
    design-time attributes for the process.
    
#### Modify the process in MDWHub
  - In MDWHub's Definition view, click the pencil icon button to edit the process.  The Toolbox view will pop up.  This is very similar to Designer's
    Toolbox view.
    
  - The next step in refining our process is to add multiple outcomes based on our validation result.  Double-click the Stop activity to open its
    property tabs.  To indicate success, on the Definition tab change the activity name to Created (we'll actually create a bug in the next section).
  
  - Now drag another Process Finish activity from the Toolbox.  Name it Rejected, and using the shift-click-drag technique link it downstream 
    from Validate Request.  Double click the link you just created and on its Definition tab set the Result to "invalid".  And on the transition
    leading to the Created finish activity set the Result to "accepted".  Notice that the Result values you enter become labels for their transitions
    on the canvas.  If these labels seem mislocated, you can drag them to a better position.  Your process should now look something like this:
    ![multiple outcomes](../images/multiple-outcomes.png)

  - With these changes in place our script can drive the direction of flow by way of its return value.  On the Validate Request Design tab, click
    the Edit link and change the script content to this:
    ```groovy
    if (bugTitle.length() > 512)
        response = 'invalid'
    else
        response = 'accepted'
    return response
    ```
    Click the Save button at the top of the page.  Again elect to overwrite the existing version, and uncheck 'Commit and push to VCS remote'.
    
#### Run the process in MDWHub
  - After saving, click the Cancel button to close MDWHub's process editor.  Find and click the Definition nav link to switch to the process-centric
    (versus asset-centric) view of your workflow.
    
    This view has a Run button ![run button](../images/run-btn.png), which you can click to invoke your process.
    
  - Click the Process List nav link or the Workflow tab again to view the list of completed instances.  Drill into the latest instance.  
    Unless you entered a super-long bug title, your flow should have proceeded down the "accepted" path.
    

### 3. Expose the process as a REST service
  Okay, things are about to get real.  An actual REST API for reporting a bug would take as input a lot more information than our simple 
  bugTitle string.  Now that you've had a taste of editing assets in MDWHub, we'll switch back to Eclipse and whip up a model object to 
  represent a bug and bind it to JSON.

#### Code a model object
  If you're an experienced Java developer, you're used to compiling your code and creating a deployable archive through a build script.
  In MDW things work differently.  All your code is dynamic, meaning it's compiled on-the-fly in real time by MDW as needed.  In this section
  we'll create an individual Java asset.  However, as your application evolves and becomes more complex you can build Jar file(s) and deploy
  those as dynamic assets as well.  The MDW ClassLoader takes care of finding what it needs. 
  
  - In Designer Process Explorer view, right-click on the com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs package and select New > Java Source.  Name the source
    Bug.java and click Finish.  Edit the code to look like this:
    ```java
    package com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs;
    
    import org.json.JSONObject;
    import com.centurylink.mdw.model.Jsonable;
    
    public class Bug implements Jsonable {
        
        public Bug(JSONObject json) {
            bind(json);
        }
        
        private Long id;
        public Long getId() { return id; }
        
        private String title;
        public String getTitle() { return title; }
        public void setTitle(String title) { this.title = title; }
        
        private String description;
        public String getDescription() { return description; }
        public void setDescription(String description) { this.description = description; }
        
        public String toString() {
            return getJson().toString(2);
        }
    }
    ```
    This code illustrates a few concepts essential to understanding how MDW JSON binding works:
      - Our model class implements [Jsonable](http://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/model/Jsonable.html).
        The Jsonable interface provides an ultra-convenient mechanism for autobinding and serializing from/to JSON.
      - By convention every Jsonable implements a constructor that takes an org.json.JSONObject.  In our constructor we invoke the `bind()` method,
        which is where the autobinding magic happens.
      - Thanks to Java 8, unlike typical interfaces Jsonable comes with default behavior.  The two critical default methods are `bind()` and `getJson()`.
        These provide autobinding and serialization, respectively.  Yet, being an interface, Jsonable can be mixed in with any existing object model.
    
#### Change to Jsonable process variables    
  - After saving Bug.java, reopen the Create Bug process.  Change variable name "bugTitle" to "request".  It's a convention in MDW that service processes
    declare a "request" input variable and a "response" output variable.  Since we're adopting this convention, the content of incoming HTTP requests and outgoing
    responses will automatically be bound to our variables.  Also change the types of both "request" and "response" to com.centurylink.mdw.model.Jsonable.

  - Back on the Script property tab for Validate Request, under the Documents section select the "response" variable and move it from Read-Only to
    Writable.  The reason we have to do this is that so-called [document variables](../../development/built-in-variable-types) in MDW are passed by reference
    (whereas strings and native types are passed by value).  Passing by reference is nice because we can update the same document from many different subflows.
    But a byproduct of this is that the engine needs to lock this variable for update when our activity is invoked.  Hence the need to mark "response" as writable.
    ![writable doc](../images/writable-doc.png) 
    
  - Edit the Validate Request script content to look something like this:
    ```groovy
    import com.centurylink.mdw.model.StatusResponse
    import static com.centurylink.mdw.model.Status.ACCEPTED
    import static com.centurylink.mdw.model.Status.BAD_REQUEST
    
    if (request.title.length() > 512) {
        response = new StatusResponse(BAD_REQUEST)
        return 'invalid'
    }
    else {
        response = new StatusResponse(ACCEPTED)
        return 'accepted'
    }
  
    ```   
    Here we're counting on Jsonable autobinding since we access request.title through its getter method, and we expect it to contain JSON title property value.
    We assign response to a StatusResponse, which is a built-in Jsonable representing an [HTTP Status Code](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).
    
  - Save the Create Bug process after making these changes.  
  
#### Implement a JAX-RS REST endpoint

  - To facilitate path-based request handling, MDW supports [@Path](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ws/rs/Path.html) annotations.
    Paths are qualified by the containing asset package name, so for this let's create a separate, friendly-named package to house our REST service.
    Right-click on your project in Process Explorer and select New > MDW Package.  Name this new package simply "demo.api".
    
  - In the "demo.api" package create a Java source asset named Bugs.java like this:
    ```java
    package demo.api;
    
    import java.util.HashMap;
    import java.util.Map;
    
    import javax.ws.rs.Path;
    
    import org.json.JSONException;
    import org.json.JSONObject;
    
    import com.centurylink.mdw.common.service.ServiceException;
    import com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs.Bug;
    import com.centurylink.mdw.model.StatusResponse;
    import com.centurylink.mdw.services.ServiceLocator;
    import com.centurylink.mdw.services.rest.JsonRestService;
    
    @Path("bugs/")
    public class Bugs extends JsonRestService {
    
        @Override
        public JSONObject post(String path, JSONObject content, Map<String,String> headers)
                throws ServiceException, JSONException {
            String requestId = Long.toHexString(System.nanoTime());
            Object response = ServiceLocator.getWorkflowServices().invokeServiceProcess("Create Bug",
                    new Bug(content), requestId, new HashMap<>(), headers);
            return ((StatusResponse)response).getJson();
        }
    }
    ```
    The root path of our bugs service is governed by the @Path annotation of the class.  We override `post()`
    from [JsonRestService](http://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/services/rest/JsonRestService.html)
    to handle HTTP POST requests.  When one is received, we use the MDW 
    [WorkflowServices](http://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/services/WorkflowServices.html) API
    to programmatically launch our Create Bug process, and we return the result as JSON.
    
  - After saving Bugs.java, we're ready to POST a JSON request to http://localhost:8080/mdw/services/demo/api/bugs.
    For this you can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
    Or if you don't feel like biting that off just now, MDWHub's System tab has a Messaging feature where you can submit simple HTTP requests.
    
    Here's what a request and response look like when submitted through MDWHub:
    ![post bug](../images/post-bug.png)  
  
    Something important to point out about our development cycle: Notice that we didn't perform any compilation step on our java source assets.
    We simply saved them, and Designer told MDW server to refresh its asset cache to reflect our changes next time we ran.
  
  - After submitting a request, view the corresponding process instance in Designer or MDWHub.  Confirm that the "request" and "response"
    variables are populated as expected.    
    
### 4. Document the Service API using Swagger

  [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) documentation is a powerful way to communicate the specifics of your REST interface to potential consumers.
  MDW REST services will automatically generate Swagger documentation on the fly if a few key annotations are added to the Java source asset.
  This is not only a convenient way to maintain this documentation, but it also means that it's always up-to-date versus the implementation.  

#### Add the @Api Annotation to Your Service:
  The Swagger [@Api](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X#api) annotation goes on your class declaration along 
  with the JAX-RS Path annotation. The tag value in your annotation provides a high-level description of the its purpose:

  ```java
  @Path("/bugs")
  @Api("Bugs API")
  public class Bugs extends JsonRestService {
  ```
  - At this point, instead copy/pasting code from this guide, why not download the completed Bugs.java artifact from the mdw-demo
    GitHub repository.  Right-click the link below and select Save Link As, overwriting Bugs.java in the assets/demo/api folder in your project.
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo/master/assets/demo/api/Bugs.java><br>

  - Now in Eclipse select File > Close All, and then click the Refresh Icon in Process Explorer. (**Tip**: Before refreshing Process Explorer,
    it's a good idea to save your work and close all files.  If you have assets open when refreshing, Designer does its best to reconcile your
    change versus what it reads from the hard-drive, but if it gets confused it can end up giving you heartburn).
    
  - Expand your workflow project again in Process Explorer, and open Bugs.java.  Check the
    [@ApiOperation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X#apioperation) and 
    [@ApiImplicitParams](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X#apiimplicitparam-apiimplicitparams)
    annotations to see how these document the POST operation and indicate its expected body content.
    
  - Touch and save Bugs.java to trigger Designer to invoke the Cache Refresh service on the server.  Or you can always manually refresh 
    the MDW asset cache by right-clicking on the project and selecting Server > Refresh Caches.  Yet another way to manually refresh is 
    through the System tab Tools link in MDWHub.
    
#### View generated API documentation in MDWHub 
  - Once the server cache has been refreshed, access MDWHub in your browser and click the Services tab.  Most of what you'll see listed here
    are paths for the built-in MDW services.  Scroll to the bottom to find your /demo/api/bugs resource path.  Click this link to investigate your service API docs.
    Swagger uses [JSON Schema](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2803231) syntax, so the definitive word on your API contract is depicted on the JSON tab.
    A more readable [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) representation can be viewed on the YAML tab.  The raw content of both of these tabs is itself available via MDW's
    built-in service API (in fact, that's how MDWHub gets them).
    
  - MDW incorporates [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) to make available a handy user interface for surveying REST APIs.
    Click on the Swagger subtab to check out the POST operation's docs.  Swagger-UI renders expandable elements for each model object.
    If you expand POST, you can even click the "Try it out" button to submit a request from here.
    ![swagger-ui](../images/swagger-ui.png)
