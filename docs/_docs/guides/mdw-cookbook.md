Let's walk through the essential features of MDW.  All the source code referenced in this guide
is available to clone in its completed state from the [mdw-demo repository](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo).  

## Sections in this Guide
  MDW is a [workflow](../../features-guide) framework specializing in [microservice orchestration](../../presentations/microservices).
  We'll focus these topics, and dive into other key features like manual task handling and web UI development.
  Our use case is a bug management workflow.

## 1. Implement a REST Service
### 1.1 Setup
  - **Get MDW**  
    The easy way to run MDW locally is by following the [5-minute quick start](../../getting-started/quick-start).
  - **Install the Designer plugin**  
    Assets can be created and edited in MDWHub, but for serious development you'll want to [install the Eclipse plugin](../../getting-started/install-designer).
  
### 1.2 Create a service process
  If you haven't already, import the project generated by the CLI as described in the quick-start guide:
  - From the Eclipse File menu select > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspaces.  Then browse for your project directory.
  - Switch to the MDW Designer Perspective (Window > Perspective > Open Perspective > Other > MDW Designer).  If you don't see your
    project, try clicking the Refresh toolbar icon <img src="../images/refresh.gif" class="inline" alt="refresh"> at the top of Process Explorer view.

#### Create a package  
  Everything in MDW is what we call an [Asset](../../help/assets.html), and these live in packages, 
  similar to Java packages except that they contain a whole lot more than .java source files.  Let's create a package for our
  bug handling workflow:
  - Expand your project tree in Process Explorer.  You'll see the mdw6 baseline packages imported by the CLI during `mdw init` or `mdw update`.
    The default package set is pretty scant, but MDW includes quite a few optional packages; some of which we'll cover later.
  - Right-click on your project in Process Explorer and select New > MDW Package.  Name the package "com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs".
    Don't select any Workgroup for now, as this would restrict visibility of your new package.
    ![create package](../images/create-pkg.png)
  
#### Create a process  
  - Right-click on the bugs package and select New > MDW Process.  Name the process "Create Bug".<br>
    ![create process](../images/create-proc.png)
  
    Finally we can start building.
  
  - Double-click the process title in the Designer canvas.  Look at the Properties view at the bottom of the Eclipse window, 
    and you'll observe that the associated property tab gained focus.  Property tabs are how design elements are configured.
  - Select the Design tab for the process and check the Service Process checkbox.  This tells MDW that this process is expected to run 
    synchronously and return a response in real time.
  
#### Add some process variables
  - Now click on the Variables property tab.  To start with, add a string input variable that'll hold the bug's title.  Name the variable 'bugTitle',
    and make sure its Mode is Input.  To hold the retrieved commit info, add another string variable named 'response' with mode Output.
    Here's what the Variables property tab should look like when you're finished:
    ![add variables](../images/add-vars.png)

#### Add a script activity
  The Designer Toolbox view contains the available activities for building our process.  In MDW, an *activity* is an individual step in a workflow,
  and an *activity implementor* is a Java class that defines an activity's behavior.  MDW comes with a boatload of [prebuilt activities](../../development/built-in-activities).
  Quite possibly you'll want to extend the toolbox with your own custom activities.  We'll cover that in another section of the cookbook.
  
  - In the Toolbox view locate the activity labeled "Execute Script" and drag it onto the Designer canvas.  Double-click the activity in the canvas,
    and select its Definition property tab.  Change the label from "New Execute Script" to "Validate Request".  Click any blank spot on the canvas to preview this label change.
    
  - Double-click the activity again and select its Script tab. Make sure the language is Groovy, and then click the Edit Script link.
    This opens an Eclipse editor.  Write a script to confirm that the bug title contains less than 512 characters:
    ```groovy
    if (bugTitle.length() > 512)
        response = 'invalid'
    else
        response = 'accepted'    
    ```
    Notice how this script has implicit access to the `bugTitle` and `response` variables, for both reading and assigning.
    
  - Save the script editor contents in Eclipse by selecting File > Save from the menu (or by clicking the disk icon in the Eclipse toolbar, or by typing ctrl-s).
    You'll be reminded via a warning dialog that the script content goes with the process, and therefore the process must be saved as well.
    We'll save the process in a minute. 
    
  - Now to integrate the script activity into our workflow.  Switch back to the 'Create Bug' process editor again in Designer.
    Select the link (or *transition* in MDW-speak) connecting the Start and Stop activities, and hit Delete.
    Drag the Validate Request activity between Start and Stop.  Next comes the trickiest part of mastering Designer.  We use the so-called "shift-click-drag" mechanism for linking activities on the canvas.
    
  - Hold down the Shift key on your keyboard, click on the upstream activity, and continue holding down the mouse left click button while dragging the cursor 
    to the downstream activity (shift-click-drag).  Repeat this technique to draw links so that your process looks like this:   
    ![script activity](../images/script-activity.png)
    
  - Save your process.  Elect to "Overwrite current version" and to "Remember this selection for future saves". 
    In shared environments MDW needs to support multiple asset versions simultaneously, but for convenience locally you'll mostly overwrite existing versions.  


### 1.3. Run the process and view its instances
  For testing and refining your process, it's convenient to run it from Designer.  When a process is executed MDW creates an *instance* which contains
  distinct runtime values.  Unlike definition artifacts which are maintained in Git, instance data is stored in a database.  The quick-start mechanism
  employs an [Embedded DB](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/blob/master/mdw-workflow/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/db/readme.md), 
  so when your server's running the database is automatically online.
  
#### Run the process from Designer
  - If your MDW server is not running already, open a command window in your project directory and type `mdw run`.
  
  - Right-click on the Create Bug process in Process Explorer and select Run.  This opens the Eclipse launch configuration dialog.  Click on the Variables
    tab and double-click the Value cell for the bugTitle input variable.  Enter something for the bug title.
    
    ![set variables](../images/set-vars.png)
    
  - Click the Run button to execute your process.
  
#### View the process instance in Designer
  - Right click on Create Bug in Process Explorer and select View Instances.  The Process Instances tab appears, showing a table with the last-run
    instance at the top.  Double-click the instance.  The instance runtime view opens up in the Designer canvas, and in place of the Toolbox the Activity Status
    Legend appears.
    
  - Double-click on the process title or a blank place in the runtime view. Property tabs for an instance contain runtime data for that instance.
    Select the values tab to see the variable values for this instance:
    ![designer process instance](../images/proc-inst-designer.png)

#### View the same instance in MDWHub
  - Fire up your browser and navigate to MDWHub: <http://localhost:8080/mdw>.  Click the Filter button, and in the Status dropdown select Completed.
    Click the Create Bug link for your instance.
    
  - Click the process title or a blank place in the MDWHub runtime view.  The Inspector pane appears.  Click the Values tab in Inspector to view
    variable values:
    ![hub process instance](../images/proc-inst-hub.png)
    
  - To see how a process definition looks in MDWHub, click on the Definition Nav link for the instance.  Click a blank spot in the canvas to view
    design-time attributes for the process.
    
#### Modify the process in MDWHub
  - In MDWHub's Definition view, click the pencil icon button to edit the process.  The Toolbox view will pop up.  This is very similar to Designer's
    Toolbox view.
    
  - The next step in refining our process is to add multiple outcomes based on our validation result.  Double-click the Stop activity to open its
    property tabs.  To indicate success, on the Definition tab change the activity name to Created (we'll actually create a bug in the next section).
  
  - Now drag another Process Finish activity from the Toolbox.  Name it Rejected, and using the shift-click-drag technique link it downstream 
    from Validate Request.  Double click the link you just created and on its Definition tab set the Result to "invalid".  And on the transition
    leading to the Created finish activity set the Result to "accepted".  Notice that the Result values you enter become labels for their transitions
    on the canvas.  If these labels seem mislocated, you can drag them to a better position.  Your process should now look something like this:
    ![multiple outcomes](../images/multiple-outcomes.png)

  - With these changes in place our script can drive the direction of flow by way of its return value.  On the Validate Request Design tab, click
    the Edit link and change the script content to this:
    ```groovy
    if (bugTitle.length() > 512)
        response = 'invalid'
    else
        response = 'accepted'
    return response
    ```
    Click the Save button at the top of the page.  Again elect to overwrite the existing version, and uncheck 'Commit and push to VCS remote'.
    
#### Run the process in MDWHub
  - After saving, click the Cancel button to close MDWHub's process editor.  Find and click the Definition nav link to switch to the process-centric
    (versus asset-centric) view of your workflow.
    
    This view has a Run button <img src="../images/run-btn.png" class="inline" style="position:relative;top:6px" alt="run button">, which you can click to invoke your process.
    
  - Click the Process List nav link or the Workflow tab again to view the list of completed instances.  Drill into the latest instance.  
    Unless you entered a super-long bug title, your flow should have proceeded down the "accepted" path.
    

### 1.4. Expose the process as a REST service
  Okay, things are about to get real.  An actual REST API for reporting a bug would take as input a lot more information than our simple 
  bugTitle string.  Now that you've had a taste of editing assets in MDWHub, we'll switch back to Eclipse and whip up a model object to 
  represent a bug and bind it to JSON.

#### Code a model object
  If you're an experienced Java developer, you're used to compiling your code and creating a deployable archive through a build script.
  In MDW things work differently.  All your code is dynamic, meaning it's compiled on-the-fly in real time by MDW as needed.  In this section
  we'll create an individual Java asset.  However, as your application evolves and becomes more complex you can build Jar file(s) and deploy
  those as dynamic assets as well.  The MDW ClassLoader takes care of finding what it needs. 
  
  - In Designer Process Explorer view, right-click on the com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs package and select New > Java Source.  Name the source
    Bug.java and click Finish.  Edit the code to look like this:
    ```java
    package com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs;
    
    import org.json.JSONObject;
    import com.centurylink.mdw.model.Jsonable;
    
    public class Bug implements Jsonable {
        
        public Bug(JSONObject json) {
            bind(json);
        }
        
        private Long id;
        public Long getId() { return id; }
        
        private String title;
        public String getTitle() { return title; }
        public void setTitle(String title) { this.title = title; }
        
        private String description;
        public String getDescription() { return description; }
        public void setDescription(String description) { this.description = description; }
        
        public String toString() {
            return getJson().toString(2);
        }
    }
    ```
    This code illustrates a few concepts essential to understanding how MDW JSON binding works:
      - Our model class implements [Jsonable](http://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/model/Jsonable.html).
        The Jsonable interface provides an ultra-convenient mechanism for autobinding and serializing from/to JSON.
      - By convention every Jsonable implements a constructor that takes an org.json.JSONObject.  In our constructor we invoke the `bind()` method,
        which is where the autobinding magic happens.
      - Thanks to Java 8, unlike typical interfaces Jsonable comes with default behavior.  The two critical default methods are `bind()` and `getJson()`.
        These provide autobinding and serialization, respectively.  Yet, being an interface, Jsonable can be mixed in with any existing object model.
    
#### Change to Jsonable process variables    
  - After saving Bug.java, reopen the Create Bug process.  Change variable name "bugTitle" to "request".  It's a convention in MDW that service processes
    declare a "request" input variable and a "response" output variable.  Since we're adopting this convention, the content of incoming HTTP requests and outgoing
    responses will automatically be bound to our variables.  Also change the types of both "request" and "response" to com.centurylink.mdw.model.Jsonable.

  - Back on the Script property tab for Validate Request, under the Documents section select the "response" variable and move it from Read-Only to
    Writable.  The reason we have to do this is that so-called [document variables](../../development/built-in-variable-types) in MDW are passed by reference
    (whereas strings and native types are passed by value).  Passing by reference is nice because we can update the same document from many different subflows.
    But a byproduct of this is that the engine needs to lock this variable for update when our activity is invoked.  Hence the need to mark "response" as writable.
    ![writable doc](../images/writable-doc.png) 
    
  - Edit the Validate Request script content to look something like this:
    ```groovy
    import com.centurylink.mdw.model.StatusResponse
    import static com.centurylink.mdw.model.Status.ACCEPTED
    import static com.centurylink.mdw.model.Status.BAD_REQUEST
    
    if (request.title.length() > 512) {
        response = new StatusResponse(BAD_REQUEST)
        return 'invalid'
    }
    else {
        response = new StatusResponse(ACCEPTED)
        return 'accepted'
    }
  
    ```   
    Here we're counting on Jsonable autobinding since we access request.title through its getter method, and we expect it to contain JSON title property value.
    We assign response to a StatusResponse, which is a built-in Jsonable representing an [HTTP Status Code](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).
    
  - Save the Create Bug process after making these changes.  
  
#### Implement a JAX-RS REST endpoint

  - To facilitate path-based request handling, MDW supports [@Path](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ws/rs/Path.html) annotations.
    Paths are qualified by the containing asset package name, so for this let's create a separate, friendly-named package to house our REST service.
    Right-click on your project in Process Explorer and select New > MDW Package.  Name this new package simply "demo.api".
    
  - In the "demo.api" package create a Java source asset named Bugs.java like this:
    ```java
    package demo.api;
        
    import java.util.Map;
    
    import javax.ws.rs.Path;
    
    import org.json.JSONException;
    import org.json.JSONObject;
    
    import com.centurylink.mdw.common.service.ServiceException;
    import com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs.Bug;
    import com.centurylink.mdw.services.rest.JsonRestService;
        
    @Path("/bugs")
    public class Bugs extends JsonRestService {
        
        @Override
        public JSONObject post(String path, JSONObject content, Map<String,String> headers)
                throws ServiceException, JSONException {
            String requestId = Long.toHexString(System.nanoTime());
            return invokeServiceProcess("Create Bug", new Bug(content), requestId, null, headers);
        }
    }    
    ```
    The root path of our bugs service is governed by the @Path annotation of the class.  We override `post()`
    from [JsonRestService](http://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/services/rest/JsonRestService.html)
    to handle HTTP POST requests.  When one is received, we use the superclass helper method  
    [invokeServiceProcess()](http://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/services/rest/JsonRestService.html#invokeServiceProcess-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object-java.lang.String-java.util.Map-java.util.Map-).
    to programmatically launch our Create Bug process, and we return the result as JSON.
    
  - After saving Bugs.java, we're ready to POST a JSON request to http://localhost:8080/mdw/services/demo/api/bugs.
    For this you can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
    Or if you don't feel like biting that off just now, MDWHub's System tab has a Messaging feature where you can submit simple HTTP requests.
    
    Here's what a request and response look like when submitted through MDWHub:
    ![post bug](../images/post-bug.png)  
  
    Something important to point out about our development cycle: Notice that we didn't perform any compilation step on our java source assets.
    We simply saved them, and Designer told MDW server to refresh its asset cache to reflect our changes next time we ran.
  
  - After submitting a request, view the corresponding process instance in Designer or MDWHub.  Confirm that the "request" and "response"
    variables are populated as expected.    
    
### 1.5. Document the Service API using Swagger

  [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) documentation is a powerful way to communicate the specifics of your REST interface to potential consumers.
  MDW REST services will automatically generate Swagger documentation on the fly if a few key annotations are added to the Java source asset.
  This is not only a convenient way to maintain this documentation, but it also means that it's always up-to-date versus the implementation.  

#### Add the @Api Annotation to Your Service:
  The Swagger [@Api](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X#api) annotation goes on your class declaration along 
  with the JAX-RS Path annotation. The tag value in your annotation provides a high-level description of the its purpose:

  ```java
  @Path("/bugs")
  @Api("Bugs API")
  public class Bugs extends JsonRestService {
  ```
  - At this point, instead of copy/pasting code from this guide, why not download the completed Bugs.java artifact from the mdw-demo
    GitHub repository?  Here's the asset on GitHub:<br>
    <https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo/blob/master/assets/demo/api/Bugs.java>.   
    From the GitHub source view, right-click on Raw and select Save Link As, overwriting Bugs.java in the assets/demo/api folder in your project.
    Or just click the link to view the raw source in your browser, and copy/paste it into the asset. 

  - Now in Eclipse select File > Close All, and then click the Refresh Icon in Process Explorer. (**Tip**: Before refreshing Process Explorer,
    it's a good idea to save your work and close all files.  If you have assets open when refreshing, Designer does its best to reconcile your
    change versus what it reads from the hard-drive, but if it gets confused it can end up giving you heartburn).
    
  - Expand your workflow project again in Process Explorer, and open Bugs.java.  Check the
    [@ApiOperation](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X#apioperation) and 
    [@ApiImplicitParams](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X#apiimplicitparam-apiimplicitparams)
    annotations to see how these document the POST operation and indicate its expected body content.
    
  - Touch and save Bugs.java to trigger Designer to invoke the Cache Refresh service on the server.  Or you can always manually refresh 
    the MDW asset cache by right-clicking on the project and selecting Server > Refresh Caches.  Yet another way to manually refresh is 
    through the System tab Tools link in MDWHub.
    
#### View generated API documentation in MDWHub 
  - Once the server cache has been refreshed, access MDWHub in your browser and click the Services tab.  Most of what you'll see listed here
    are paths for the built-in MDW services.  Scroll to the bottom to find your /demo/api/bugs resource path.  Click this link to investigate your service API docs.
    Swagger uses [JSON Schema](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2803231) syntax, so the definitive word on your API contract is depicted on the JSON tab.
    A more readable [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) representation can be viewed on the YAML tab.  The raw content of both of these tabs is itself available via MDW's
    built-in service API (in fact, that's how MDWHub gets them).
    
  - MDW incorporates [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) to make available a handy user interface for surveying REST APIs.
    Click on the Swagger subtab to check out the POST operation's docs.  Swagger-UI renders expandable elements for each model object.
    If you expand POST, you can even click the "Try it out" button to submit a request from here.
    ![swagger-ui](../images/swagger-ui.png)


### 1.6. Auto-validate requests against the API
  Swagger uses Java reflection to automatically determine the property types in our Bug.java model class.  In some situations the default interpretation 
  is not sufficient, or maybe you want to add clarifying text to certain fields.  This is where [API model annotations](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X#model-declaration)
  come in.
  
#### Add API model annotations
  - Grab the completed version of mdw-demo's Bug.java asset, and let's take a look at how to incorporate API model annotations.  Here's
    [Bug.java on GitHub](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo/blob/master/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/demo/bugs/Bug.java).  Overwrite your
    current workspace version with this latest code.
    
  - In Eclipse close all files, refresh Process Explorer, and open the Bug.java asset you just downloaded.  Note this annotation on the `id` field:
    ```java
    @ApiModelProperty(readOnly=true)
    private Long id;  
    ```
    Since id is a generated value, we disallow its inclusion in submitted requests by setting it to *readOnly*.
    
  - Now check out the `title` property:
    ```java
    @ApiModelProperty(value="Headline bug information", required=true)
    @Size(max=512)    
    private String title;
    ```
    To include descriptive text in the generated Swagger docs, we've set a value on @ApiModelProperty.  We've also flagged it as a required field.
    And we've introduced a new annotation *@Size* which is not from Swagger, but actually from the Java [JSR-303 Validations](http://beanvalidation.org/1.0/spec/)
    standard.  This tells consumers of our API about our maximum length constraint.
    
  - Refresh the server cache and revisit the Swagger docs on MDWHub's Services tab to confirm that these changes are reflected in the docs.
  
#### Incorporate auto-validation
  - With these model annotations in place, we can now replace our crude hand-crafted validations in the Validate Request script activity with something
    more comprehensive.  Open the Create Bug process and change the script to this:
    ```groovy
    import com.centurylink.mdw.model.StatusResponse
    import static com.centurylink.mdw.model.Status.ACCEPTED
    import static com.centurylink.mdw.model.Status.BAD_REQUEST
    import com.centurylink.mdw.service.api.validator.*
    
    def validator = new SwaggerModelValidator('POST', '/demo/api/bugs')
    
    try {
      validator.validateRequestBody(request.json, true)
      response = new StatusResponse(ACCEPTED)
      return 'accepted'
    }
    catch (ValidationException ex) {
      response = new StatusResponse(BAD_REQUEST, ex.message)
      return 'invalid'
    }
    ```
  - Post a request with this body to test failed validation:
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas varius vitae ante sit amet aliquam. Proin sodales orci sapien, ut consectetur turpis porttitor vel. Nullam arcu ex, bibendum ac condimentum eu, interdum at odio. Morbi a maximus odio. Aenean faucibus lacus libero, eget bibendum lacus imperdiet non. Phasellus quam elit, finibus eu orci nec, facilisis fringilla dolor. Duis porttitor, nisi id congue iaculis, orci lectus eleifend tellus, nec interdum augue eros id lacus. Donec sollicitudin cursus imperdiet.",
      "description": "This title is too long"
    }    
    ```
    You'll get an HTTP 400 response, and you can view the process instance to confirm that it took the 'invalid' path.
    
    
## 2. Build Out the Bugs Workflow

### 2.1 Implement a custom activity
  A bug probably requires someone to take action.  In MDW, steps requiring manual intervention are represented by the 
  [TaskInstance](http://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/model/task/TaskInstance.html) model object.
  To integrate our Bug object into the Create Bug workflow, we'll use the TaskInstance model, and map the data to our Bug object.
  
#### Create an activity implementor asset
  - Fire up Designer, right-click the com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs package, and select New > Activity > General Activity.
    ![create activity](../images/create-activity.png)<br>
    Label the activity Persist Bug, and in the Icon text box type *bug.png*.  Click Next, and for Dynamic Java Class Name, type *PersistBugActivity*.
  
  - After clicking Finish, replace the generated Java code with 
    [PersistBugActivity.java on GitHub](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo/blob/master/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/demo/bugs/PersistBugActivity.java),
    which implements `execute()` to tell MDW's workflow engine what to do.  These lines from `execute()` take care of creating the task:
    ```java
    public Object execute(ActivityRuntimeContext runtimeContext) throws ActivityException {
      Bug requestBug = (Bug)getValue("request");
      String taskTemplate = getTaskTemplate();
      try {
        AssetVersionSpec templateAsset = new AssetVersionSpec(taskTemplate, "0");
          TaskTemplate template = TaskTemplateCache.getTaskTemplate(templateAsset);
          if (template == null)
              throw new DataAccessException("Task template not found: " + template);
  
          TaskServices taskServices = ServiceLocator.getTaskServices();
          TaskInstance instance = taskServices.createTask(template.getTaskId(), getMasterRequestId(), 
              getProcessInstanceId(), null, null, requestBug.getTitle(), requestBug.getDescription());
  
          loginfo("Created task instance " + instance.getId() + " (" + template.getTaskName() + ")");
      ....
    ```
    Here we're calling [TaskServices.createTask()](../../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/services/TaskServices.html#createTask-java.lang.Long-java.lang.String-java.lang.Long-java.lang.String-java.lang.Long-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-), 
    which requires a [Task Template](../../help/taskTemplates.html) asset to specify a pattern.
    The getTaskTemplate() method returns a string which illustrates MDW's convention for referring to a specific asset:
    `com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs/ResolveBugAutoform.task`.
    This equates to assets/com/centurylink/mdw/demo/bugs/ResolveBugAutoform.task in your project directory.  Unlike a qualified Java class name,
    a slash separates the package from the asset name.  We'll create the task template asset in the next step.
    
  - When you clicked Finish in the activity creation wizard, aside from the generated PersistBugActivity.java asset, another one named 
    "Persist Bug.impl" was created to capture the  metadata you just entered.  Since they can lead to clutter and they're usually edited via 
    the Toolbox, impl assets are filtered from Process Explorer by default.  You can click the Filter icon to configure this, 
    or view the .impl file from the assets directory on your hard drive.
    
  - Also remember that we told the Designer wizard to use bug.png for our activity's toolbox icon.  You probably guessed that the icon image is an asset as well.
    Download [bug.png from GitHub](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo/blob/master/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/demo/bugs/bug.png)
    into assets/com/centurylink/mdw/demo/bugs in your project.  Then close all open files and refresh Process Explorer to see it appear.
    
  - Now finally you can drag the Persist Bug activity from the toolbox onto the Create Bug process design.  Name it "Save Bug", and link it 
    into your process like so:   
    ![create bug 2](../images/create-bug-2.png)<br>
    Now save your process changes.

#### Create a task template asset
  - Right-click on the com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs package and select New > Task Template.  Name the template ResolveBugAutoform.task, and 
    make sure you select AutoForm for Language/Format:<br>
    ![create task template](../images/create-task-template.png)<br>
    
  - When the wizard finishes, ResolveBugAutoform.task will open in Designer's template editor.  Notice the tabs at the bottom of the editor pane.
    On the General tab, for Task Name enter the [Java Expression](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjddd.html) `${bug.title}`, 
    which tells MDW to use the *bug* process variable's *title* value.<br>
    ![task template editor](../images/task-template-editor.png)<br>
    
  - Then on the Workgroups tab, add Developers to the Selected Groups.  That's all we need to do to the template at the moment.  Later on we'll
    learn how to customize the web UI and other aspects of our task.  But for now save the template with just these changes.  
     
#### Run the revised process and view the task
  - We want to submit a (valid) bug request via HTTP POST as before.  But you may have noticed that getTaskTemplate() in the GitHub version
    of PersistBugActivity returns ResolveBugAutoform only conditionally.  To meet that condition, you'll want to use your posting tool to add a 
    header `autoform` with a value of `true`.  If that's not convenient, then simply change getTaskTemplate() to return a hardcoded response:
    ```java
    private String getTaskTemplate() throws ActivityException {
        return "com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs/ResolveBugAutoform.task";
    }
    ```
    After submitting, the process flow should run to completion.  On the Values tab, double-click the responseHeaders variable.  
    When submitting you may have noticed that the HTTP status code on the response
    changed to 201 (Created), and the response headers now include *Location*.  Review the code in PersistBugActivity.execute() to see
    how responseHeaders is populated.  It's another example of a convention in MDW whereby you can readily control the behavior of 
    your REST service.

  - Point your browser to MDWHub, and click on the Tasks tab.  You should see the top task named whatever you submitted for the bug's title.
    Click to drill into the task.  What the...?  You got a blank page!  It's common practice in MDW to deliver optional features in the
    form of asset packages.  MDWHub's Task UI relies on a couple of these packages.  You can import them using MDWHub or Designer.
    We'll use Hub since we're already there.
    
  - Click on the Admin tab in MDWHub, and select the Assets nav link to see your packages (ignoring any errors regarding Git Branch mismatches).
    Click Import > Discover.  Then click the Discover button on the discovery page to see a list of available packages.
    Select these two packages, and then click  Import button at the bottom of the page:
    ![task packages](../images/task-packages.png)<br>
    
  - The com.centurylink.mdw.node package requires a server restart after being imported.  So restart your server,
    and then when you revisit the Tasks tab and click on the link it should be able to display the task page.
    
  - In Designer, close all open files and refresh Process Explorer to reflect the newly-imported packages. 
  
### 2.2 Invoke a subprocess
  What to do when a bug gets created?  With human action required, it'll be a long-running workflow, which obviously cannot respond in real time.
  Whereas Create Bug is a service process and must respond within a second or two, once the bug is created we want to spawn a separate flow
  that can proceed at length.  The pattern to accomplish this in MDW is to invoke a subprocess.
  
#### Use the Invoke Subprocess activity
  - First create a new process under package com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs.  Call this process "A Bug's Life".  We'll not check Service Process
    on the Design tab this time.  By definition service processes are not long-running, and they're restricted from containing certain activities.
    Now add an Input variable named 'bug' with type com.centurylink.mdw.model.Jsonable.  Save "A Bug's Life".
    
  - Return to the Create Bug process, and from the Toolbox drag an Invoke Subprocess activity.  Name it "Invoke Bug Subflow", and Link it 
    after Save Bug and before Created.  Double click the subprocess activity and on the Design tab select "A Bug's Life" for Subprocess. 
    Also uncheck Synchronous since we don't want to wait for the subflow to complete before responding.  Lastly, click the Bindings tab which
    displays all the input variables from our selected subprocess.  Enter ${response} as the Binding Expression for the 'bug' input variable:
    ![create bug 3](../images/create-bug-3.png)<br>
    
    The [Java expression](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjddd.html) ${response} in this context means that the 'response' 
    variable from Create Bug will be bound to 'bug' in the subflow.
    
  - Save everything and invoke the service as before.  Open the latest "Create Bug" process instance in Designer or MDWHub, and select the
    Invoke Bug Workflow activity.  On the Subprocesses property tab, double-click (in Designer) or click (in Hub) the "A Bug's Life" instance.
    View the subflow Values to confirm that 'bug' is populated correctly.

### 2.3 Add a manual task activity

#### Insert a manual task 
  - Returning to "A Bug's Life", drag an Autoform Manual Task activity and link it between Start and Stop.  Change the label to
    "Await Resolution".  On the Design tab, select the ResolveBugAutoform task template we create.  For Instance ID Variable instead of selecting
    from the dropdown, type the expression `${bug.id}`.  This tells MDW that we've already created the task (in Save Bug), and we just need 
    our activity to await task completion.<br>
    ![a bugs life](../images/a-bugs-life.png)<br>
    
  - Save and submit a request to to run.  Confirm that the status of Await Resolution in "A Bug's Life" is *Waiting*.  This indicates that flow will resume 
    once the associated manual task is completed.

#### Perform actions on the task
  - In MDWHub click the Tasks tab, find the just-created bug task, and drill into it.  Click the Action button and select Claim.
    By default you must be assigned a task to complete it (although this behavior [can be overridden](../../help/taskAction.html)).
    Click the Action button again and select Complete.
    
  - Return to the Bug's Life instance in MDWHub or Designer, and refresh to confirm that now the subflow has run to completion.
    Manual tasks provide a great mechanism for humans to interact with workflows.  Aside from triggering actions, another key aspect
    of manual tasks in MDWHub is enabling data entry.  In [subsection 2.5](#25-consume-a-rest-service) we'll explore how, with 
    [AutoForm tasks](../../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/activity/task/AutoFormManualTaskActivity.html), 
    data entry can be tied to variables through configuration, and a data-entry form is generated on the fly by MDWHub.
    Later, in [section 3](#3-integrate-a-custom-web-ui), we'll create an entirely custom web UI based around a 
    [Custom task](../../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/activity/task/CustomManualTaskActivity.html).
    
### 2.4 Create a Spring asset
  MDW uses [Spring](https://spring.io/) internally, and one of the key extensibility mechanisms MDW provides is the ability to create
  your own custom Spring contexts.  Unlike regular Spring app contexts, your Spring assets are dynamic in that changes can be applied without
  a redeployment.
  
#### Customize baseline data  
  - In Designer, open the ResolveBug.task template.  Check out the options available in the Category dropdown.  None of these options
    seem like a good fit for a bug.  It would be nice to add our own values as options.  This is the problem we'll solve by creating a
    Spring asset.
    
  - Right-click on the com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs package and select New > Spring Config.  Name the asset bugsContext.spring, and click Finish.
    Paste this into bugsContext.spring:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <beans
      xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
    
      <!-- custom baseline data -->
      <bean id="bugCategories" class="com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs.Categories" />
    </beans>
    ``` 
    Aside from namespace boilerplate, this context contains a single Spring bean declaration with an *id* of bugCategories.
    The *id* is not significant, but the *class* attribute is.  This is where we plug in our custom behavior.
    
  - Create a new Java Source asset in the same package named Categories.java.  Paste its content from
    [Categories.java on GitHub](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo/blob/master/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/demo/bugs/Categories.java).
    The important thing to note about this code is this:
    ```java
    public class Categories extends MdwBaselineData {
        private List<TaskCategory> bugCategories;
  
        public Categories() {
            bugCategories = new ArrayList<>();
            bugCategories.add(new TaskCategory(201L, "ISSUE", "Bug"));
        }
    ....    
    ```     
    We extend [MdwBaselineData](../../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/dataaccess/file/MdwBaselineData.html), which provides the entry-point 
    for us to designate our own values for certain reference data in MDW.  In the Categories constructor, we're building our own list
    of TaskCategories to include along with the MDW built-in ones.
    
#### Configure the ResolveBugAutoform task template    
  - Designer caches this type of data obtained from the MDW server, so close everything and refresh Process Explorer.  When you
    re-expand the project tree, that's when Designer pulls these values from the server.  After that, open up ResolveBugAutoform.task and
    change the Category to ISSUE - Bug.
    
  - While we're here let's explore some other aspects of manual tasks.  We could specify a [due interval](../../help/taskSLA.html)
    in minutes or hours.  But a hardwired interval turns out to be not that useful.  Instead let's implement a
    [PrioritizationStrategy](../../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/observer/task/PrioritizationStrategy.html)
    to dynamically determine a task's priority level as well as when it's due.  In the com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs package
    create a new Java Source asset named Prioritization.java with 
    [code from GitHub](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo/blob/master/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/demo/bugs/Prioritization.java).
    The logic here is very straightforward, but it's worth mentioning this annotation we haven't seen before:
    ```java
    @RegisteredService(PrioritizationStrategy.class)
    public class Prioritization ...
    ```
    The @RegisteredService annotation gives your Dynamic Java code an extensibility hook into MDW.  To see the available implementations
    you can plug in, have a look at the [All Known Subinterfaces](http://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/common/service/RegisteredService.html) 
    section of the javadoc.
    
  - Now return to ResolveBugAutoform.task and on the General tab paste the fully qualified name of the class we just created into
    Prioritization Strategy: `com.centurylink.mdw.demo.bugs.Prioritization`.  This strategy pattern is common to many attributes of
    a task template:
      - [PrioritizationStrategy](../../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/observer/task/PrioritizationStrategy.html) - priority and due interval
      - [SubtaskStrategy](../../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/observer/task/SubTaskStrategy.html) - rules for creating subtasks
      - [RoutingStrategy](../../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/observer/task/RoutingStrategy.html) - autoroute to designated workgroups
      - [AutoAssignStrategy](../../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/observer/task/AutoAssignStrategy.html) - assign to a specific person

    All these strategies have access to the instance runtime state if they extend ParameterizedStrategy like we've done.  They all also have various built-in
    strategy options available from their dropdowns.  All the dropdowns include the **Rules-Based** option, which enables you to
    maintain the rules in an Excel spreadsheet asset which acts as a [Drools decision table](https://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/6.5.0.Final/drools-docs/html/ch06.html#d0e5713).
    (Rules-based strategies depend on the optional com.centurylink.mdw.drools asset package). 
      
  - You can poke around the task template design tabs and click on the help links to explore additional template attributes,
    such as [Email and Slack notifications](../../help/taskNotices.html) based on HTML template assets.
  
  - If you're done for now, save ResolveBugAutoform.task and resubmit with various values for 'severity' to confirm its impact on the due interval
    by checking the Tasks tab in MDWHub.
    
### 2.5 Consume a REST service
  Way back in [section 1](#1-implement-a-rest-service) we covered how to produce a REST service.  Now we want to consume a REST API, specifically
  a [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), from within our workflow.  You'll find that the microservice architectural approach, with
  its emphasis on tightly-focused services, lends itself to the visual orchestration capabilities in MDW.

#### Import the microservice package
  The MDW term for an activity that invokes an external service (whatever the protocol), is *adapter activity* (or simply *adapter*).
  In the base package there's a built-in general REST adapter, but the optional `com.centurylink.mdw.microservice` package includes assets
  that are especially well-suited to the microservice paradigm.  So first we'll import this package.
   
  - Back on the Admin tab in MDWHub, select the Assets nav link and click Click Import > Discover.  Click the Discover button and select
    **com.centurylink.mdw.microservice**, and then click Import at the bottom of the page.
  
#### Add an adapter activity
  During the bug lifecycle we'll want to confirm any associated commit, and for this we'll use the [GitHub REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).
  
  - In Designer open "A Bug's Life" and drag from the toolbox a Microservice REST Adapter.  Link it between "Await Resolution" and "Close", and 
    label it "Retrieve Commit".  We need a variable to hold the adapter response, so on the process Variables tab add a local variable named 'commit'.
    We're not going to build a Jsonable model for this object, so just make the 'commit' variable type org.json.JSONObject.
    
  - On the REST adapter Design tab, make sure the GET method is selected, and paste this for Resource URL:<br>
    `https://api.github.com/repos/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo/commits/${bug.commitId}`  
        
  - Also on the activity Design tab, select GET for the HTTP Method, and in the Response Variable dropdown select 'response'.  We don't need a request
    variable for an HTTP GET.  Here's what the process should look like:
    ![a bugs life 2](../images/a-bugs-life-2.png)<br>    
    
#### Capture commitId via Autoform    
  - Now we need a way for resolvers to enter the commit ID.  Open   
  
  - Save "A Bug's Life" now.  In section 3 we'll build a page to capture data related to bug tasks, where a resolver will enter the commit ID.
    For the time being, to test our REST adapter we'll just submit a bug with commitId already populated.  Post a new request with something like this:
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Missing documentation on external Error Handler processes",
      "description": "Someone needs to step up.  I'm not saying who...",
      "severity": 2,
      "commitId": "52c7b84"
    }
    ```
    The commitId above is the short form of a valid commit hash in mdw-demo on GitHub.

  - Now check the Tasks tab in MDWHub and drill into the task for the bug you just submitted.  Claim and complete the task so then you can click
    over to the Workflow tab, select "All Processes" in the dropdown, and set the Filter to Completed to see your the latest Bug's Life at the top.
    Check the values to make sure that we got back a commit from GitHub.  Another item of note: if you click on the Retrieve Commit adapter you'll
    see that it has Requests and Responses property tabs where you can drill in to see other information like the URL and HTTP headers.
