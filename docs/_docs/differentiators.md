## MDW Differentiators

- Based on open source technologies

- Fun to work with

- Built-in Microservices

### Extensibility: 
 - The road to empowering business users with MDW goes through IT Services.  The reason why developers so quickly take to MDW is because of its flexibility.  To go beyond the dozens of prebuilt activities included out of the box, MDW provides Eclipse-based wizards for generating custom workflow steps implemented as Java classes.  These custom activities become first-class citizens in the toolbox alongside the standard MDW activities.  In fact, there's a discoverability mechanism built into Designer that enables developers to share specialized implementors and encourages reuse among the community.  Plus, for cases where custom logic needs to be made especially agile, the Dynamic Java and Script activities enable controlled, versioned, auditable and repeatable code changes with no app redeployment. 
 
###  BPM in The Cloud:
 - Using the MDW Buildpack for Cloud Foundry, it's ridiculously easy to spin up and scale a deployment space where users can collaborate on workflow assets. Authentication is through OAuth, authorization is role-based, and assets are version controlled in Git.  This rigorous chain of ownership, plus the built-in automated Cucumber testing capabilities, ensure the accountability and reproducibility you need to confidently adapt to changing business demands.
 
### Service Orientation: 
 - MDW comes with built-in protocol support for many of the most common service transports in use here at CenturyLink.  This enables developers and analysts to focus on the business purpose of their workflows rather than getting bogged down in the arcane lexicon of specific wire protocols.  Service orchestration is simply a matter of drag and drop.  Also, MDW readily interoperates with Spring and Camel to unleash existing industry-standard skillsets and achieve maximum reuse of existing assets.
