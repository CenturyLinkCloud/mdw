MDW stands for Model-Driven Workflow.  It's a Cloud-ready, Java-based workflow framework developed with the aim of delivering the benefits of Business Process Management (BPM).  MDW has the tools to help users model their business processes visually, along with a robust, scalable and extensible runtime engine to execute these processes.  MDW also comes with a toolkit for monitoring and analysis to facilitate continuous improvement.  The central idea of MDW is to foster collaboration between IT and the Business by elevating logic out of source code and into a graphical, flowchart-style representation that can be understood and owned by the rightful domain experts.
