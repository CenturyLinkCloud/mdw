MDW stands for Model-Driven Workflow.  It's a Cloud-ready, Java-based workflow framework developed with the aim of delivering the benefits of 
Business Process Management (BPM).  MDW has the tools to help users model their business processes visually, along with a robust, scalable
and extensible runtime engine to execute these processes.  MDW also comes with a toolkit for monitoring and analysis to facilitate continuous improvement.

The central idea of MDW is to foster collaboration by elevating logic out of source code and into a graphical, flowchart-style representation 
that can be understood and owned by the rightful domain experts. Here's what this looks like for the simple bug-handling workflow in the
[mdw-demo](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo) example project:
