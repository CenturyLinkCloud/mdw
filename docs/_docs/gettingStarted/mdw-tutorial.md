title: Take a Tutorial with MDW Demo
---

TODO…The instructions in this Tutorial are currently being updated.

This tutorial will guide you through creating a short, simple workflow using an existing MDW Demo project, which is hosted in CenturyLink's GitHub repository.  But before you can start this tutorial, you will need to do a `one-time` setup described in the Prerequisites bellow.

Once you get a little familiar with MDW, feel free to explore other guides and help docs to learn more about MDW features and what it can do. The links will be provided in this tutorial. 

### Prerequisites
We assume that you are already familiar with eclipse, Java, Java Web services (RESTFul/JSON and/or SOAP/XML and HTTP protocol), use of Java container concept and Maven or Gralde for building a Java project in eclipse.

- First, you will need to setup your environment. Please complete the steps 1 - 4 only in [mdw-demo/README.md](https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-demo) and return to this tutorial. Please `skip the step 5 in the mdw-demo/README.md` for now.
- You should have your eclipse workspace setup and deployed the mdw-demo project on the Tomcat server.  

### How to use this Tutorial
- We have already created a detailed guide for creating a workflow from scratch. You can follow [this link](../../designer/user-guide/) and start with the step 1 in the Designer User Guide.
