### Straight out of the box MDW gives you:

- Design-time tools for modeling and simulating workflow processes
- Built for the cloud, enabling users to build in the cloud
- Declarative business rules in the form of intuitive Excel decision tables
- Services orchestration for SOAP, REST, JMS, LDAP, JDBC, SMTP and File I/O
- Web tools for business users to manage manual tasks integrated into their workflows
- Automated or manual retry and fallout handling
- Alerts, notifications and jeopardy management based on business-owned due dates and SLAs 
- Runtime monitoring with the ability to drill down and graphically view runtime state for a particular instance
- End-to-end business intelligence and reporting tools that reflect business-defined milestones
- A discoverable repository of prebuilt workflow assets that can be used as-is or extended 

### Microservice Orchestration:
MDW helps you make sense of your microservices.  Included is a easy to use toolkit for stitching together REST 
services into an overall flow that's dynamic yet structured.  MDW provides the means, through MDWHub, to visualize
the relationships and dependencies among microservices. And to expose a REST entry point so you can deliver 
maximum value from disparate services. By adopting MDW's lightweight pattern to expose your REST API,
you'll get automatic data binding and your services become self-documenting via Swagger.

### Extensibility:
The road to empowering business users goes through MDW.
And the reason why developers so quickly take to MDW is because of its flexibility.
To go beyond the dozens of prebuilt activities included out of the box, MDW provides 
wizards for generating custom workflow steps (implemented as Java classes).
These custom activities become first-class citizens in the toolbox alongside the standard MDW activities.
In fact, there's a discoverability mechanism built into MDW that enables developers to share custom-built
specialized features and encourages reuse among the community.  
Plus, for cases where custom logic needs to be made especially agile, the dynamic Java, Script and jar assets 
allow controlled, versioned, auditable and repeatable code changes with no app redeployment. 

### BPM in The Cloud:
Using MDW's docker image, it's ridiculously easy to spin up and scale a deployment space 
where users can collaborate on design assets. Authentication is through OAuth, authorization is role-based, 
and assets are version controlled in Git.  This rigorous chain of ownership, plus the built-in automated testing 
capabilities, ensure the accountability and reproducibility you need to confidently adapt to changing business demands.
 
### Service Orientation: 
MDW comes with built-in protocol support for many of the most common service transports in use here at CenturyLink.
This enables developers and analysts to focus on the business purpose of their workflows rather than getting bogged down 
in the arcane lexicon of specific wire protocols.  Service orchestration is simply a matter of drag and drop.  
Also, MDW readily interoperates with Spring and Camel to unleash existing industry-standard skillsets.
