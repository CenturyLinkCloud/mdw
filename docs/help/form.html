<h1>Pagelet Forms</h1>

(Manual) tasks can be generated during work flow execution for fall-outs and
designed manual steps. Tasks can also be used to initiate a work flow (process).
For ease of discussion, we will call the former type of tasks
<em>in-flow</em> tasks, and the latter <em>pre-flow</em> tasks.
The form mechanism provides a simple way for designing and customizing
task display in the MDW Task Manager. If you are familiar with pre-MDW 5 task manager,
another distinct feature of the form mechanism is that it decouples the MDW process
engine from the task manager - allowing the process engine
to create tasks on a remote (especially centralized) task manager.
<p>
In-flow tasks are configured in Designer using General Manual Task activity -
follow <a href="FormDataDocumentManualTaskActivity.html">this link</a> for information
on how to configure this activity.
Pre-flow tasks are configured in Designer at a process Start activity.
Refer to <a href="ProcessStartActivity.html">this link</a>
for information on how to configure it.
<p/>
A form is a web page that is used to display
and enter data for an (in-flow or pre-flow) task. Strictly speaking we use the term <em>form</em>
to refer to the layout of the window, which is defined at the design time.
And we call the data to be displayed and modified
on a form as <em>form data</em>, which varies at run time.

<h2>Form Designs</h2>
MDW provides a simple form editor for designing forms (i.e. layout of widgets on the form window).
You can reach the form design page in the classic Designer in one of the following ways:
<ol>
  <li>For forms associated with in-flow tasks, there is button on the attribute definition page
      of the manual task activity to open the form.</li>
  <li>For forms associated with pre-flow tasks (those starting a process), there is also a button
      to open the form in the attribute definition page for the start activity of the process.</li>
  <li>In resource list page (a.k.a script list page), double click on the form you would like to see.</li>
</ol>
You can create a new form in any of the 3 places as well.
<p/>
The simplest way to design a form is to use the automatic form generation feature - there
is an auto-form button on the form design page (enabled only when entering the page
through the first two ways above), which allows you to generate the form
in the following way:
<ul>
  <li>It takes the list of variables defined in the associated process. For pre-flow tasks, it takes
      only variables in input mode.</li>
  <li>It lays out name-value pairs as simple text widgets, one by one. The label of a text widget
      is the variable name.</li>
</ul>
You can then perform some simple customizations such as:
<ul>
  <li>Dragging widgets around and resize them as you would like.</li>
  <li>Delete widgets for variables you do not want to display.</li>
  <li>Change the labels if you do not like variable names as labels (double click on the widget to 
  		open the widget attribute dialog).</li>
  <li>Specify whether the input data for a widget is required (again double-click on the widget to open
        the widget attribute dialog).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Form Widgets and Their Attributes</h2>

The simple steps introduced above roughly achieving about the same
level of customization as those provided by pre-MDW 5 tasks.
You have probably noticed that there are additional widgets other than the text widget,
and the widget attribute dialog of each widget has other attributes that can be customized.
We will cover many of these widgets and attributes in this section, leaving
some advanced ones <a href="form-advanced.html">at this link</a>.
<p>
Since a lot of attributes are common to many types of widgets, we organize this 
section by listing widget types with simple descriptions first, then listing
attributes along with their applicability to the types of widgets.

<h3>Widget Types</h3>
The following table is the list of all widget types currently supported.
<table border='1'>
  <tr><th>Widget Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>TEXT</td><td>An input text field</td></tr>
  <tr><td>TEXTAREA</td><td>Like text but allows large amount of data. It uses
  		HTML text area.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>DROPDOWN</td><td>Allow to choose from a set of options. The candidate
  			options can be static (known at design time) or dynamic (only
  			known at run time).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>RADIOBUTTONS</td><td>Same in functionality as DROPDOWN but 
  			with a different visual representation (a group of radio buttons)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>DATE</td><td>A specialized input text widget for date input</td></tr>
  <tr><td>LIST</td><td>A list box allowing to choose multiple elements, unlike
  			DROPDOWN where only one element can be selected.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>TABLE</td><td>A read-only data table</td></tr>
  <tr><td>COLUMN</td><td>A column in a TABLE.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>PANEL</td><td>An area grouping widgets together. Allow to have a title and/or border.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>TABBEDPANE</td><td>Contains a collection of TABs.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>TAB</td><td>A tab in a TABBEDPANE (<em>todo: should just use PANEL</em>)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>MBENUBAR</td><td>This is for <a href="form-advanced.html">advanced features</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>MENU</td><td>This is for <a href="form-advanced.html">advanced features</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>MENUITEM</td><td>This is for <a href="form-advanced.html">advanced features</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>BUTTON</td><td>This is for <a href="form-advanced.html">advanced features</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>LISTPICKER</td><td>This is an experimental feature.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>HYPERLINK</td><td><em>This is to be implemented</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td>INCLUDE</td><td><em>This is to be implemented</em></td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Widget Attributes</h3>
<table border='1'>
  <tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Applicable Widget Types</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Label</td><td>Almost all widgets</td>
  		<td>The label of the widget.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ID</td><td>All widgets</td>
  		<td>Generated automatically, only need to override in advanced features.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Data</td><td>Most widgets allowing to display and/or enter data</td>
  		<td>Specifies the association with the field name in the form data document.
  		   This is the variable name for auto-generated forms.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Required</td><td>Most widgets allowing to enter data</td>
  		<td>Can be yes, no or conditional</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Default Value</td><td>Most widgets allowing to enter data</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Visible when</td><td>almost all widgets</td>
  		<td>A condition specifying when the widget is visible. Default (blank) is always visible.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Modifiable when</td><td>Most widgets allowing to enter data</td>
  		<td>A condition (see below for its syntax). Default is modifiable</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Enabled when</td><td>BUTTON</td>
		<td>This is described at <a href="form-advanced.html">advanced features</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Validators</td><td>TEXT</td>
  		<td>See below</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Error Message</td><td>TEXT</td>
  		<td>The error message to display when some validation fails. If not specified,
  			a default message will be displayed on validation failure.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Can type in value</td><td>DROPDOWN</td>
  		<td>If selected, the user is allowed to type in value, in addition to selecting
  			from the drop-down list. Note there is a limitation using this feature --
  			we do not allow specifying labels different from values (as there is
  			no way to determine values for typed-in data).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Is Static</td><td>TEXTAREA</td>
  		<td>If true, this represents some static text (do not user input - but is still dynamic
  		in the sense that the content may not be known at design time). The difference from
  		non-Modifiable is that static text does not have a border or scroll bar, and it 
  		allows some limited formating such as mixed font color/size.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Image</td><td>BUTTON</td>
  		<td>This is described at <a href="form-advanced.html">advanced features</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Choices</td><td>DROPDOWN,RADIOBUTTONS,LIST</td>
  		<td>See below</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Vertical</td><td>RADIOBUTTONS</td>
  		<td>Arrange the radio buttons vertically</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Tip</td><td>Most widgets allowing to enter data</td>
  		<td>Tip text to display when the mouse is over the label of the widget.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Action</td><td>BUTTON, MENUITEM, DROPDOWN, RADIOBUTTONS</td>
  		<td>This is described at <a href="form-advanced.html">advanced features</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Hyperlink Action</td><td>COLUMN</td>
  		<td>This is described at <a href="form-advanced.html">advanced features</a></td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Static and Dynamic Choices List</h3>

The choices attribute is used by DROPDOWN, RADIOBUTTONS, and LIST to specify
candidate choice list. The choices can be specified statically (known at the design time),
or determined only dynamically (at run time).
<p> 
Static choice list is like <code>Red,Green,Blue</code>.
<p>
If you would like the value of the data to be something different from the labels users see,
an example is <code>R:Red,G:Green,B:Blue</code>. In this case the data value
will be R, G or B, but the widget shows options as Red, Green and Blue.
<p>
If the choice list is not known at the design time, you can specify something like
<code>$$.StateChoices</code> where "$$." is the special indicator for dynamic
choice list and the name StateChoices refers to a field in the form data document
(the dynamic choice list is included in the run time data), as shown below:
<pre>
&lt;FORMDATA>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='COUNTRY'>USA&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='STATE'>Colorado&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='CITY'>Denver&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='STREET'>930 15th&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='DueDate'>2009-03-09&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;TABLE NAME='StateChoices'>
     &lt;ENTRY NAME='CO'>Colorado&lt;/ENTRY>
     &lt;ENTRY NAME='UT'>Utah&lt;/ENTRY>
     &lt;ENTRY NAME='WY'>Wyoming&lt;/ENTRY>
  &lt;/TABLE>
  &lt;TABLE NAME='LIST_DATA'>
     &lt;ENTRY NAME='R'>red&lt;/ENTRY>
     &lt;ENTRY NAME='G'>green&lt;/ENTRY>
     &lt;ENTRY NAME='B'>blue&lt;/ENTRY>
  &lt;/TABLE>
  &lt;TABLE NAME='TABLE_DATA'>
     &lt;ROW NAME='ROW'>
        &lt;FIELD NAME='CUID'>jxxu&lt;/FIELD>
        &lt;FIELD NAME='FirstName'>Jiyang&lt;/FIELD>
        &lt;FIELD NAME='LastName'>Xu&lt;/FIELD>
     &lt;/ROW>
     &lt;ROW NAME='ROW'>
        &lt;FIELD NAME='CUID'>doakes&lt;/FIELD>
        &lt;FIELD NAME='FirstName'>Don&lt;/FIELD>
        &lt;FIELD NAME='LastName'>Oakes&lt;/FIELD>
     &lt;/ROW>
  &lt;/TABLE>
&lt;/FORMDATA>
</pre>
Note the values are specified as the XML attribute <code>NAME</code>
and the labels are the text within the ENTRY tag.
<h3>List and Table Data</h3>
The values of LIST and TABLE widgets are not single fields.
The LIST_DATA and TABLE_DATA in the above example show
how the list data and table data look like in the form data document.
Note that the list data looks the same as dynamic choice list - the difference
is just how they are used.
<p>
Currently, the values of a list is the collection of NAME attribute values
and the texts within ENTRY tags are ignored (note they are used
as labels when the list is used as <it>candidate</it> list).
<p>
For tables, the XML NAME attributes define the column names
to which the field should be displayed, and the text within the ENTRY tag is
the actual data value to be displayed.

<h3>Conditions</h3>
Several boolean widget attributes described above allow conditional values
in addition to simple true or false. These include whether a widget is visible
or modifiable.
The following examples exhibit the syntax:
<pre>
   COUNTRY=="USA"
   STATE=="UT" or STATE=="CO"
   (STATE=="UT" or STATE=="CO") and COUNTRY=="USA"
</pre>
The simplest form is <i>data-field-name</i><code>=</code><i>string-value</i>.
You can combine simple conditions using the keywords "and" and "or".

<h3>Validators</h3>
Out-of-box we provide 4 validators:
<dl>
  <dt>mask(pattern)</dt>
    <dd>This specifies a mask. This validator is currently the only one
      implemented on the web browser client side. The pattern is a sequence
      of characters that the input data must match one by one, with the following
      rule:
      <ul>
      	<li>A character "9" must match a digit (0-9)</li>
      	<li>A character "L" must match a letter (a-z and A-Z)</li>
      	<li>A character "A" must match an alphanumeric (a digit or a letter)</li>
      	<li>A character "X" matches any character</li>
      	<li>Any other pattern character must match exactly the input character</li>
      </ul>
      There is a convenient exception to the last rule: if the pattern character
      is not 9, L, A or X, and the input character is an alphanumeric, the validator
      automatically inserts the pattern character. An example is to specify
      the pattern of a telephone number as "999 999-9999" - the user
      can type in "3034445555" in addition to "333 444-5555", and in the former
      case the validator inserts the space and dash as the user types. 
      </dd>
  <dt>length(min,max)</dt>
  	<dd>Specify the minimum and maximum length of the field</dd>
  <dt>range(low,high)</dt>
    <dd>The field must be an integer number and within the specified the range.</dd>
  <dt>pattern(regexp)</dt>
  	<dd>Specifies a regular expression that the value must match.</dd>
</dl>
We will cover custom validation using external rules engine
in <a href="form-advanced.html">advanced features</a>.

<h2>Creating and Processing Form Data Documents</h3>
For pre-flow tasks, the form data document is automatically created
when the user opens a form page, and the form data document
will be the owner of the process instance started by the
task at submission. You can access
the data in one of the several standard ways (follow
<a href="ProcessStartActivity.html">this link</a> for more information).
<p>
For in-flow tasks, the form data documents are either created automatically
by MDW, or created/supplemented in custom activity implementors.
See <a href="FormDataDocumentManualTaskActivity.html">FormDataDocumentManualTaskActivity</a> for more details.

<h2>HTML Templates</h2>
The GUI builder allows to specify an HTML template
which you can use to place static header and footer information,
to customize look-and-feel through CSS, etc.

<p/>
The HTML templates are also stored in the RULESET_TABLE and
can be created using the designer. The following is a sample
HTML template:
<pre>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
#{MDW.GENERATED_HEAD}
&lt;style>
.form-body {
	background-color: #e0e040;
	border: 1px solid #f08080; }
.form-label {
	font-weight:bold;
	font-family:Helvetica;
	font-size:12px; }
h1 {
	color:#00c000;
	font-family:Helvetica;
}
&lt;/style>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body bgcolor='gray'>
&lt;h1>ESOWF Task Manager&lt;/h1>
&lt;a href='/MDWTaskManagerWeb/facelets/tasks/myTasks.jsf'>My Tasks&lt;/a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;a href='/MDWTaskManagerWeb/facelets/tasks/workgroupTasks.jsf'>Work Group Tasks&lt;/a>
#{MDW.GENERATED_BODY}
#{MDW.INIT_SCRIPT}
&lt;p>
&lt;font color='#c0c0c0'>
ESOWF Version #{MDW.APPLICATION_VERSION}
&lt;br>
Powered by MDW Version #{MDW.VERSION}
&lt;/font>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>
The example above shows all the place holders currently supported, which
includes:
<dl>
  <dt>#{MDW.GENERATED_HEAD}</dt><dd>You must include this in the head
     portion, as this will include default style sheet and required JavaScript
     scripts</dd>
  <dt>#{MDW.GENERATED_BODY}</dt><dd>You must include this in the body
     portion.</dd>
  <dt>#{MDW.INIT_SCRIPT}</dt><dd>You must include this in the body
     portion, after MDW.GENERATED_BODY. This includes scripts that
     will pop up error messages, etc.</dd>
  <dt>#{MDW.VERSION}</dt><dd>This is the version number of the MDW Framework.</dd>
  <dt>#{MDW.APPLICATION_VERSION}</dt><dd>This is the version number
     of the work flow application.</dd>
  <dt>#{MDW.WIN_ID}</dt><dd>Browser window name</dd> 
  <dt>#{MDW.CONTEXT_PATH}</dt><dd>The context path of the web application.</dd> 
  <dt>#{MDW.<var>property-name</var>}</dt><dd>Taken from the property of the given name</dd> 
</dl>

<h2>CSS Classes</h2>

The following CSS classes are used in the HTML generator
to control the look-and-feel of the page.
You can override them in HTML template.
<table border='1'>
<tr><td>form-body</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-panel</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-panel-header</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-label</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-input</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-table-td</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-table-th</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-table-footer-button-disabled</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-table-footer-button</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-table</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-table-footer</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-tabheader</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-tabheader-active</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-tabheader-inactive</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>form-tabbody</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>dropmenudiv</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>chromestyle</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>simpleMenu</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Miscellaneous Topics</h2>

<h3>Preview</h3>
The form design page uses Swing widget so the look-and-feel may not be the same
as you would see on a web page. There is a run button on the page that allows
you to see the actual page rendered by JSF engine used by MDW. You will be 
prompted with a dialog for form data XML document - this allows you to test
the form with data.

<h3>Pre-flow Task Access</h3>
In-flow tasks are typically accessed through regular MDW Task Manager function,
where tasks are assigned to user groups. This mechanism is normally not suitable
for pre-flow tasks, where users need to initiate the task instance and 
submit it to start a process.
<p/>
Instead, pre-flow tasks
are typically accessed directly through a URL, in the following form:
<br>
<code>http://<i>host-name</i>:<i>port</i>/MDWTaskManagerWeb/form.jsf?formName=<i>form-name</i></code>
<p>
There is also a way to use Swing forms, and the URL to access the Swing forms look like
<br>
<code>http://<i>host-name</i>:<i>port</i>/MDWDesignerWeb?cuid=<i>cuid</i>&amp;page=FORM_MAIN&amp;objid=<i>form-name</i></code>

<h3>Export/Import Task and Forms</h3>
<em>to be completed</em>

<h3>Advanced Features</h3>
If the above mentioned features are not sufficient for your customization needs, MDW
provides advanced customization capabilities: <a href="customWeb.html">Custom Web</a>.
