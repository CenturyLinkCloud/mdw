<h1>Processes</h1>

<p>Introduction to processes can be found in <a href='introduction.html'>Introduction</a>.
The following describes the attributes you can configure.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transition with no Label: This describes how transitions without a label is used.
      <ul>
        <li>Acts as Default: if the completion code does not match
        	labels of any outgoing transitions, the transitions 
        	without labels are then traversed. The transitions
        	are also traversed when the completion code is null.</li>
        <li>Matches Null Return Code: with this option,
        	transitions without labels are only traversed
        	when the completion code is null. If a transition
        	should be used as default, the special label <code>DEFAULT</code>
        	must be specified.</li>
     </ul></li>
  <li>Process Type: Regular or Service. See below for description
  	of service processes.</li>
  <li>Transition Retry Count Default: the value can be 
  		either "Retry unlimited" (allowing unlimited retries),
  		or "Retry not allowed" (allowing no retries).
  		Note that this attribute only sets the default
  		for newly created transitions. You can always set individually
  		the transition retry count after the transitions are created.
  		Also note that if you change the value of this attribute,
  		it will not change the existing transitions.</li>
  <li>Performance Level:
  		It specifies a performance level for running this processes.
  		See the section on performance level below for details.</li>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Service Processes</h2>
<p>Typically, a process is started asynchronously, meaning the 
originator does not wait for the completion of the process.
It is often desired for the work flow applications to provide
also <em>services</em>, which return synchronous responses
to the requesters in real time.</p>

<p>In order to take advantage of the MDW infrastructure (external event handler,
adapters, activities, etc),
MDW provides the so-called <em>service processes</em>  for this purpose.
Service processes were also known as
<em>synchronous processes</em> earlier, but we now try to avoid
this term to avoid confusion with calling a sub process synchronously.</p>

<p>Service processes are executed in a single thread without using internal
JMS messages. This is to allow the responses being captured and sent back
to the invoker. Service processes are defined and handled pretty much
the same way as regular processes, with some limitations incurred by
the requirement that they are executed in a single thread.</p>

<p>With MDW 4.* and MDW 5.0 implementation, service processes have 
the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
   <li>No parallel branching is allowed, namely all transitions out of an activity
   		must be mutual exclusive.</li>
   <li>No activities can suspend (wait for timer, external event, manual response, etc).
   		This is to say that
   		timer wait, event wait, sub process invocation, manual tasks are not allowed.
   		Adaptor activities are allowed, but you cannot get responses from asynchronous
   		adaptors as that will require event wait activities. As a result,
   		fall-out subprocesses and fall-out tasks are not allowed.</li>
   <li>The process should define an output (or input/output) variable named "response" and set its
       value, which is used to return as a response. The variable is typically
       a document of XML Bean type, although any other type can be used
       and the return message as a string will be translated by the variable
       translator.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an exception is generated during process execution, the exception message
is captured by MDW and thrown to the external event handler. The standard
process start event handler will create a standard error message as response.</p>

<p>MDW 4.* and 5.0 implement service processes using a different execution engine
from the one for executing regular processes. MDW 5.1 has re-implemented 
the service processes using the same engine for regular processes. As a result,
MDW 5.1 implementation has less limitations, especially it does allow
parallel branching (although their execution is serialized), subprocess
invocation, and synchronization activity.
The following types activities are still not allowed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Event wait and timer wait activities</li>
  <li>Manual task activities</li>
  <li>Invoking multiple process activities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance Level</h2>

<p>With MDW 5.2 implementation, you can set 4 different performance levels
to service processes and 3 to regular processes. Here are their description:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1: All process, activity, transition, and
  		variable instances as well as documents are persisted in database. No in-memory cache
  		is used.</li>
  <li>3: All process, activity, transition, and
  		variable instances as well as documents are persisted in database, but
  		variable instances and documents are cached for each engine processing session
  		to speed up read accesses.</li>
  <li>5: This is for service processes only.
        All process, activity, and transition instances are persisted in database;
		variable instances and documents are created in memory cache only, not persisted
  		in database.</li>
  <li>9: All process, activity, transition and
  		variable instances as well as documents are stored in memory cache only. No database
  		persistence is used. For service processes, one memory cache is used
  		for each top level invocation to a service process; for regular processes,
  		a shared memory cache is used for all executions at this performance level.</li>
</ul>

<p>The performance level of a process instance is typically determined
by the performance level attribute configured for its process definition,
and when the attribute is not configured (is blank, 0, or null), the default
performance levels are used. Two properties are used to specify default performance levels:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>mdw.performance.level.service</code>: defines the default
    	performance level for service processes. When the property is not defined,
    	the hard coded default of 3 is used.</li>
    <li><code>mdw.performance.level.regular</code>: defines the default
    	performance level for regular processes. When the property is not defined,
    	the hard coded default of 3 is used.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>For service processes, there are two exception rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For main service processes that are started from event handlers using API call
    	to the method <code>ProcessEngineDriver.invokeService()</code>,
    	if the <code>performance_level</code> argument is passed 
		in with a non-zero value, then this performance level is used.</li>
	<li>For a service process started as a subprocess of another service process,
		its performance level is inherited from the parent process.</li>
</ul>
