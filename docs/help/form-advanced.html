<h1>Advanced Form Features</h1>

Model-view-control is a well accepted pattern for GUI development.
With the simple form mechanism introduced at <a href="form.html">this link</a>,
we can see that:
<ul>
  <li>Form data documents represent the "model" part</li>
  <li>Forms represent the "view" part - they define how the data are to be viewed.</li>
  <li>For controls, a set of limited actions are allowed by MDW, including
     <ul>
       <li>For pre-flow tasks, submit the form, which starts a process instance</li>
	   <li>For in-flow tasks, you can choose predefined actions such as Complete and Retry</li>
	   <li>Limited customization are allowed for in-flow tasks through process definitions
	   		(custom task actions)</li>
	 </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

The advanced features we describe in this page are mostly related to allow much richer
controls (custom actions). These include mainly:
<ul>
   <li>Ability to navigate to different pages (for example, it may take more than one
       screen to complete entries for a pre-flow task before submission, as
       	in the case of a service order or complex trouble ticket).</li> 
   <li>Ability to use pop-up dialogs</li>
   <li>Ability to obtain data from external systems.</li>
   <li>Ability to perform cross-field form data validation using external rules engine.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Communications between Process Engine and Task Manager</h2>

The communication between the process engine and the task manager
is all through form data documents on JMS or EJB.
The actions that the sender expects the receiver to perform
are included in the form data documents as root-element attributes and meta fields.
The following is an example of form data documents sent from the engine
to the task manager when creating an in-flow task instance:

<pre>
&lt;FORMDATA ID='TaskInstance:13345' ACTION='@CREATE_TASK'
		FORM='Fallout Task' APPNAME='CCWF'>
  &lt;META NAME='DUE_IN_SECONDS'>86400&lt;/META>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='COUNTRY'>USA&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='STATE'>Utah&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='CITY'>&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='STREET'>&lt;/FIELD>
&lt;/FORMDATA>
</pre>

And the following is an example of form data documents sent from the task manager
to the engine after the user selects "Complete" action on a task instance:

<pre>
&lt;FORMDATA ID='TaskInstance:13345' ACTION='@TASK_ACTION'>
  &lt;META NAME='TASK_ACTION'>Complete&lt;/META>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='COUNTRY'>USA&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='STATE'>Colorado&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='CITY'>Denver&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='STREET'>930 15th&lt;/FIELD>
&lt;/FORMDATA>
</pre>
In the following we describe all the meta information that may be present
in form data documents.

<h3>Meta Information on Form Data Documents</h3>

In addition to actual data to be presented, 
form data documents may contain 3 types of meta information.

<h4>Root-element attributes</h4>
  <table border='1'>
  <tr><td>ID</td><td>ID of the task instance. For in-flow tasks, this is in the form
       <code>TaskInstance:</code><i>id</i>, where <i>id</i> is the activity instance
       ID of the activity creating the manual task (not the ID of TASK_INSTANCE in the 
       task manager!) For custom actions described below, this
       is in the form of <code>w.<i>cuid</i>.<i>window_name</i></code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>FORM</td><td>The form name to be used to present the data</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ACTION</td><td>Action to be taken (see below)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>APPNAME</td><td>This is used to look up engine URL from configuration.</td></tr>
  </table>
  
<h4>Meta data fields</h4>
  <table border='1'>
  <tr><td>PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID</td><td>The process instance ID where the task is created.
		not used when the task is not associated with a process instance.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>MASTER_REQUEST_ID</td><td>the master request ID of associated process instance.
		not used when the task is not associated with a process instance.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>DUE_IN_SECONDS</td><td>Due date/time in seconds. The GUI will convert 
 		the data into a user friendly unit such as days and hours</td></tr>
  <tr><td>TASK_ACTION</td><td>Only used with @TASK_ACTION to specify which action
		the user has submitted</td></tr>
  <tr><td>@PROMPT</td><td>for post-actions</td></tr>
  <tr><td>@TITLE</td><td>Browser title</td></tr>
</table>

The role of the root element attributes and meta data fields are very similar.
The main distinction is that the former are needed for almost all task actions
(except synchronous responses),
whereas the latter are needed only for some task actions (e.g. PROCESS_INSTANCE_ID
is not used for pre-flow tasks).

<h4>Error Messages</h4>

<table border='1'>
  <tr><td>ERROR</td><td></td></tr>

</table>

<h3>Built-in Actions</h3>

The following lists the built-in actions communicated between the client (browser),
the task manager, and the engine.
<dl>
  <dt>@ASSIGN_TASK</dt>
  		<dd>This action is used within task manager (from client to task manager)
  		   to assign task to a user,
  		   claim a task, release a task, or forward the task to a different user.
  		   Without argument, this action will claim the task for the current
  		   user if the task status is Open, or it will release the task
  		   if the task status is Assigned and the assignee is the current user.
  		   <em>to be completed: arguments for assigning to a user,
  		   or forwarding to a user.</em>
  		</dd>
  <dt>@COMPLETE_TASK</dt>
  		<dd>This is sent from the task manager to the engine when the user
  		    completes a task instance. No argument is required,
  		    but you can specify optionally a completion code,
  		    as in <code>@COMPLETE_TASK?completionCode=foo</code>.
  		    The completion code will be used by the process engine
  		    in determining how to transition to the next activity.
  		</dd>
  <dt>@CANCEL_TASK</dt>
  		<dd>This is sent from the task manager to the engine  when the user
  			cancels a task instance.
  		   <em>to be completed: argument to abort the process</em>
  		</dd>
  <dt>@CREATE_TASK</dt>
  		<dd>This is sent from the engine to the task manager for creating an in-flow task instance.
  		   The following meta information are needed: <em>to be completed</em>
  		</dd>
  <dt>@START_PROCESS</dt>
  		<dd>This is sent from the task manager to the engine when the user
  		   submit a pre-flow task to start a process.
  		   The following meta information are needed: <em>to be completed</em>
  		</dd>  
  <dt>@GET_TASK</dt>
    	<dd>This is used internally and sent from the engine to the task manager 
    	   for getting task instance data, to be displayed in the designer.
  		   The following meta information are needed: <em>to be completed</em>
  		</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Custom Actions</h2>

The actions we described so far are mostly triggered by features built-in to
MDW process engine and task manager.
<p>
The form designer allows to associate custom actions to BUTTON and MENUITEM widgets.
MENUITEM must be owned by a MENU, which is typically owned by a MENUBAR,
and can also be owned by another MENU (thereby behaves as a submenu), or some other
container widgets such as PANEL, PAGELET and TAB (thereby behaves as a pop-up menu).
<p>
A <em>custom form action</em> is implemented as a java class
that implements <code>com.centurylink.mdw.common.utilities.form.FormAction</code>.
The class needs to implement the method <code>handleAction</code>, which
should take the current form data document
and the action name as input and return another form data document to
be presented. The returned form data document may specify
a different form to present the data, through the root-element attribute FORM.
Form actions are triggered by the users
(pressing a button or selecting a menu item)
and the task manager sends the action to the engine, which instantiates the 
form action class and invokes its handleAction method.
<p>
Form actions can also be associated with a DROPDOWN, in which case any time
the user changes the drop down value, the action will be triggered the same
way as pressing a button. Similarly, you can also associate an action with
a radio button group. Additionally, you can associate an action with 
a COLUMN in a TABLE, in which case, the data fields in the column
will become hyper links and clicking on a link will trigger an action as above.
<p>

The actions can also be the built-in action <code>@START_PROCESS</code>,
as well as one of the following additional built-in actions:
<dl>
  <dt>@DIALOG</dt>
  		<dd>This is to open a dialog. The form associated with the dialog 
  		   is specified in the argument <code>form</code>, and the data document
  		   for the dialog is a copy of the current window's (the parent).</dd>
  <dt>@OK</dt>
  		<dd>This action is used in a modal dialog. It copies the form data document of the dialog
  		    to the parent window and closes the dialog.</dd>
  <dt>@CANCEL</dt>
  		<dd>This action is used in a modal dialog. It discards the form data document of the dialog
  		    and closes the dialog. <em>To be implemented: use this to close
  		       window and log out as well.</em></dd>
  <dt>@WINDOW</dt>
  		<dd>This action is used to open a new window. The form associated with the new window 
  		   is specified in the argument <code>form</code>, , and the data document
  		   for the dialog is a copy of the current window's.</dd>
  <dt>@PAGE</dt>
  		<dd>TThis action is used to switch to a new page
  			(new form). The data document is not changed.</dd>
  <dt>@REPAINT</dt>
  		<dd>This action is used to refresh the entire page or some widgets on the page 
  		(through Ajax).</dd>
  <dt>@SKIN</dt>
  		<dd>This action is used to set a different skin (background color, font side, etc)</dd>
  <dt>@PROMPT</dt>
  		<dd>This action is for post action only -- described later</dd>
  <dt>@ASSIGN_TASK</dt>
  		<dd>This action is used within task manager (from client to task manager)
  		   to assign task to a user,
  		   claim a task, release a task, or forward the task to a different user.
  		   The following meta information are needed: <em>to be completed</em>
  		</dd>
  <dt>@COMPLETE_TASK</dt>
  		<dd>This is sent from the task manager to the engine when the user
  		    completes a task instance. No argument is required,
  		    but you can specify optionally a completion code,
  		    as in <code>@COMPLETE_TASK?completionCode=foo</code>.
  		    The completion code will be used by the process engine
  		    in determining how to transition to the next activity.
  		</dd>
  <dt>@CANCEL_TASK</dt>
  		<dd>This is sent from the task manager to the engine  when the user
  			cancels a task instance.
  		   <em>to be completed: argument to abort the process</em>
  		</dd>
</dl>
When an action needs arguments (for both built-in and custom actions),
we use URL-like syntax, as in:
<pre>
   @DIALOG?form=Dialog test
   com.qwest.roms.action.CreateOrder?ORDT=CHG&ORDN=C12334550
</pre>

<h3>Post Actions</h3>
As we mentioned above, if a custom action sets the root-element attribute FORM,
then the task manager will present the return data document using that form
instead of the current form (the one triggered the action). This effectively
allows the custom code to control which page to display next.
<p>
There are times that we would like to have other special behavior controlled
by the custom form actions, after returning the data document to be displayed.
We call this type of special behavior as <em>post actions</em>, and they are
achieved by setting the root-element attribute ACTION in the return form data
documents. Many of the built-in actions above can be used as post actions
as well. Here is a list of all actions allowed to be post actions:

<table border='1'>
  <tr><th>Post Action</th><th>Behavior</th></tr>
  <tr><td>@DIALOG</td><td>Open a dialog window. The form is specified in the
  			root-element attribute FORM</td></tr>
  <tr><td>@OK</td><td>Close the dialog and copy the form document to the parent page</td></tr>
  <tr><td>@CANCEL</td><td>Close the dialog and discard its form document</td></tr>
  <tr><td>@WINDOW</td><td>Open a new window. The form is specified in the
  			root-element attribute FORM</td></tr>
  <tr><td>@PROMPT</td><td>This action is for post action use only. It triggers
  		a prompt dialog on the next page, and the prompt text is taken from
  		the meta data field @PROMPT</td></tr>
</table>
