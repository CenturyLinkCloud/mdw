<h1>Manual Tasks Waiting for Events</h1>

The implementor <code>CustomManualTaskActivity</code>
allows the manual tasks to listen to external events
while waiting for users to complete the tasks.
Please refer to <a href="taskAction.html">this link</a> for general
description of manual task activities.

<h2>Responding to Events while Waiting for Task to Complete</h2>

It uses the same mechanism as <code>EventWaitActivity</code> to register
the event waits (following <a href="EventWaitActivity.html">this link</a>
for details of event wait registration and other details).

<p>
When the task receives an event while waiting for user to complete the task,
the task activity can be left in one of the 3 statuses:

<ul>
  <li>Canceled. The activity instance as well as the task instance will be canceled.</li>
  <li>Hold. The activity instance will be put on a hold status (showing cyan color
  		in the designer's process instance view). While the activity instance in hold status,
  		user completion of the task will be recorded but will not resume the 
  		activity instance. When the
  		activity is put back on waiting status (see <a href="EventWaitActivity.html">this link</a>
  		for discussion on how this can happen), if the task has been completed or
  		another event it is waiting for has been received,
  		the activity instance will process that.</li>
  <li>Waiting. The activity instance continues waiting (i.e. still actively listening for
      task completion action and events).</li>
</ul>

<strong>Note:</strong>
<br>1.  Task activities that listen for <i>non-recurring</i> events should never be
placed in HOLD status.  This would cause infinite looping whenever a task instance resumes
waiting from hold status because non-recurring events that have already arrived
would always trigger a transition.
<br>2. When you want to call a Correction Handler or Cancellation handler after an event is received completion code should be set to CORRECT or ABORT respectively. 
Please notice that you do not put Cancelled:: or Hold:: before the completion status like you do for Event Wait activities.
<p>
To provide custom code handling unsolicited events, you will need to override 
<code>processOtherMessage(String message)</code>. 
The method is passed in with one argument, which is the entire message. The default
method does nothing. The completion code after processing the message is configured
in the designer, but you can override it in the code by invoking <code>setReturnCode()</code>.

<h2>Task Callbacks</h2>
The activity <code>CustomManualTaskActivity</code>
also supports <em>task callbacks</em>, which are used in the scenario when the task
instance needs to invoke functionalities through the engine.
<p>
The task callbacks work in the following way:
<ul>
  <li>Through customized task detail page in the task manager, an API call
  		is made to the engine, as shown in the following synopsis:
  		<pre>
  	FormServer server = new FormServer();
  	String response = server.callEngine(request, taskInstanceId, timeoutSeconds);
  		</pre>
  		</li>
  <li>MDW sends the request (through EJB) to the activity instance corresponding
      to the task instance and invokes its customizable method 
  	 <code>String processTaskCallRequest(String request)</code>. The method
  	 should typically be overridden to extract data from the request message
  	 into process variables, and returns a completion code.</li>
  <li>MDW then puts the task activity instance in hold status and makes a
     transition according to the completion code.</li>
  <li>The process definition should have activities processing the request,
     and finally follows a transition back to the activity. This last transition
     <em>must</em> have the special label <code>RESUME:Callback</code>,
     and the preceding activity must return this as its completion code 
     (or, it returns null completion code and there is not an outgoing transition
      without label - MDW will follow any transitions with RESUME labels
      in this case).</li>
  <li>MDW will then invokes the customizable method 
  		<code>String processTaskCallResponse()</code>, which should be overridden 
  		to construct a response message.</li>
  <li>MDW will put the task activity instance back in waiting status and
      deliver this response (through JMS) as the return value of the <code>callEngine()</code>
      method made in the first step above.</li>
</ul>
We note that this design is temporarily done for MDW 4.4. 
MDW 5 will allow customization of task manager done through 
engine code rather than task manager code (customizing event handlers
and activity implementors instead of customizing task manager itself)
and this functionality will then be natively supported, without the 
need of making API calls from the task manager.
