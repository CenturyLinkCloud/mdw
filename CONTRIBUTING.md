     ```
     npm install
     ```

4. Build in IntelliJ IDEA
   - Run IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
   - Select Open Project and browse to mdw/mdw
   - In the Gradle tool window, execute the buildDev task.

5. Use [Embedded DB](/mdw-workflow/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/db/readme.md) or set up an external MySQL database as described in [this readme](/mdw/database/mysql/readme.txt)

6. Edit configuration files to suit local environment:
   - mdw/config/mdw.yaml (locally, use absolute paths for mdw.asset.location and mdw.git.local.path)
   - mdw/config/access.yaml (set devUser to yourself)
   - mdw/config/seed_users.json

7. Run Spring Boot Jar in IntelliJ IDEA
   - From the IntelliJ menu select Run > Edit Configurations.
   - Click **+** > Jar Application.
   - For Path to Jar, browse to mdw/deploy/app/mdw-boot-6.1.XX-SNAPSHOT.jar

   - Save the configuration and type ctrl-alt-R to run/debug MDW.

8. MDWHub Web Development
   - To avoid having to reassemble the boot jar to test web content changes, add this to your IntelliJ run configuration:
     `-Dmdw.hub.dev.override.root=../mdw-hub/web`
