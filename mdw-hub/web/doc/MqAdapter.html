<h1>Using Activity Implementor MQ Adapter</h1>

The class <code>
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/adapter/mqseries/MqSeriesAdapter.html">
com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.adapter.mqseries.MqSeriesAdapter</a></code>
implements an adapter activity that can be used to send MQ messages.
The adapter is intended for both asynchronous messages (sending messages only - using
another event wait activity to receive the responses if they are expected) 
and synchronous messages (sending messages and waiting for responses in the same
activity).
<p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>
The following attributes are used by this implementor:

<ul>
  <li>Queue Manager. This attribute specifies the MQ Series queue manager name</li>
  <li>Queue Name. This specifies the MQ queue name to which message need to be sent </li>
  <li>Reply Queue Name. This specifies a MQ queue name to receive the response.</li>
  <li>Correlation ID. If an asynchronous response is expected, or the message is an asynchronous response
      to an asynchronous external message, the correlation ID may need to be specified.
      The value of the attribute allows to contain place holders for dynamic contents.
      The syntax for place holder is a "$" and a variable name enclosed in braces ("{" and "}"),
	  such as <code>{$my_variable_1}</code>. Besides process variables, the following variable names
	have predefined meanings:
	<table>
 	 <tr><td>{$ProcessInstanceID}</td><td>Has the value of the process instance ID</td></tr>
 	 <tr><td>{$MasterRequestID}</td><td>Has the value of the master request ID</td></tr>
 	 <tr><td>{$ActivityInstanceID}</td><td>Has the value of the activity instance ID</td></tr>
	</table>
	</li>
  <li>Host Name. This attribute specifies the MQ Server Name if adapter is intended to connect remote MQ Server</li>
  <li>Channel Name. This attribute specifies the MQ Series Channel Name if adapter is intended to connect remote MQ Server</li>
  <li>Port. This attribute specifies the Port if adapter is intended to connect remote MQ Server
        If it is not specified then default port 1414 will be used</li>
  <li>Request Variable. This is a variable name. The request message sent to external
      system is taken from the value of this variable.</li>
  <li>Response Variable. This is a variable name that will receive the response message,
      when the adapter is synchronous (Wait for response is true). It is ignored when
      the adapter is asynchronous.</li>
  <li>Log req/resp. This is a Boolean flag to turn on or off logging of messages
      to and from the external systems. The messages are logged in the database table
      DOCUMENT</li>
  <li>Wait for response. When it is true, the adapter is synchronous, meaning it is waiting
      for a response; when it is false, the adapter is asynchronous, meaning it sends the message
      and moves on to the next activity.</li>
  <li>Retry Exceptions: A comma separated list of fully qualified class names to retry on when 
      those exceptions are thrown.</li>
  <li>Max tries: the maximum number of tries (original and retries) when
      there is a connection failure (when <code>ConnectionException</code> is thrown).
      If it is not specified, the default value is 1, namely does not retry.</li>
  <li>Retry interval: the number of seconds to wait for the next retry attempt.
      If the value is not specified, 120 seconds is used as the default.</li>
   <li>Response Timeout. This is the time out value, in seconds, for waiting for responses.</li>
  <li>Message XSD. This is for documentation purpose only. If a valid URL is specified,
      you can open the XSD directly from the designer by clicking the "Open Link" button 
      on the right side of the attribute specification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extending the Implementor</h2>
If your customization needs cannot be completely met by 
the attributes above, you can consider subclassing this implementor.
