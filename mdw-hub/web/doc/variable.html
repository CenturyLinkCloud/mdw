<h1>Variables</h1>

Variables are associated with processes, and their scope is within
the same process, with the following two exceptions:
<ul>
   <li>Embedded processes share the same variables as the parent processes</li>
   <li>For MDW 3 compatibility, variables defined by parent process or
       ancestor process instances are still accessible, but we discourage
       using variables this way and will retire the feature in the future</li>
</ul>
A variable is associated with a type, which defines the class name
of the objects that the variable can take as values. MDW provides a set
of predefined variable types.
<p>
MDW variables are persisted in databases as strings in order to preserve their values
during long running business processes. Each variable type is associated
with a variable translator, which translates between the persistent format
(strings) and the object format.
<p>
For simple data types (string, integer, date, etc), the variable values are 
stored along with the variable instance in the VARIABLE_INSTANCE table. For
complex data types such as XML documents, service orders, and tables, the objects
are stored in the DOCUMENT table, and the values of the variables are
of the class DocumentReference, which is basically a reference (ID) to
the document object in the DOCUMENT table.
<p>
Documents can also be used outside the context of variables, typically
for storing messages received from or sent to external systems.
<p>
We are covering these in more details below.

<h2>Variable Mode</h2>
A variable can have one of the following five modes, which define
how the variables receive and output their values when the process
is invoked.
<ul>
  <li>Input. The initial value of the variable is passed in from the caller,
      when a new process instance is created. Its value can be changed
      within the process but will not impact variables of parent process instances.</li>
  <li>Output. The initial value of the variable is not initialized. The
      calling process needs to specify a variable of the parent process
      to receive the value of this variable.</li>
  <li>Input/Output. The calling process needs to specify a variable of the parent process
      to map to this variable.
      The initial value of the variable is copied from the variable of the parent,
      and when the process instance terminates, the value of the variable
      will be copied back the the variable of the parent.</li>
  <li>Local. The variable does not receive value from the calling process
      or output it back.</li>
  <li>Static. The value of the variable is initialized at design time, through
      the designer.</li>
</ul>
Please refer to <a href="InvokeSubProcessActivity.html">this link</a> for information
regarding to sub process invocation.

<h2>Accessing Variables in Activity Implementors</h2>

The base class for activity implementors, BaseActivity,
defines quite a few methods for accessing variables.
<p>
To get or set values of variable instances, you can use
the methods <code>getParameterValue</code> and <code>setParameterValue</code>,
as in the examples:
<pre>
    Integer value = (Integer)this.getParameterValue("my_variable_name");
    setParameterValue("my_variable_name", new Integer(123));
</pre>
Note you will need to ensure the object class matches the declared
variable type for the given variable instance.
For historical reasons, the method names refer to variables
as "parameters", which are only appropriate when they are used
for parameter passing (input/output modes).
<p>
The following table contains other methods related to variables,
and refer to Javadoc for more information on the methods.
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Example method</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
<tr><td>getVariableInstanceVO(varname)</td><td>get the variable instance object,
	which contains properties about the variable instance
	in addition to the value</td></tr>
<tr><td>getParameters()</td><td>return an array of all variable instance objects
for the process instance</td></tr>
<tr><td>VariableTranslator.toString(vartype, value)</td>
     <td>Convert the value object to the string format in the database</td></tr>
<tr><td>VariableTranslator.toObject(vartype, string)</td>
     <td>Convert the string format into an object of the given variable type</td></tr>
</table>

<h2><a id="documents">Documents</a></h2>
The main difference between a document variable and a primitive (non-document)
variable is that the former is bound to a reference (DocumentReference) to 
a document (the real value), whereas the latter is bound directly to the value.
<p>
The type of the variable (indeed the translator associated with the variable type)
determines whether the variable is a document variable -- the translator
for a document variable type must extends the class <code>DocumentReferenceTranslator</code>
which itself extends the class <code>VariableTranslator</code>, whereas
the translator for a non-document variable type extends <code>VariableTranslator</code>
directly. A <code>DocumentReferenceTranslator</code> contains
final implementation of the two abstract methods, <code>toString()</code>
and <code>toObject()</code>, of <code>VariableTranslator</code>,
while demands two additional abstract methods, <code>realToString</code>
and <code>realToObject</code>, to be implemented by concrete classes.
The basic methods translate between <code>String</code> and <code>DocumentReference</code>,
whereas the two new methods translate between <code>String</code> and
the actual object class such as <code>org.w3c.dom.Document</code>.
<p>
A document is stored in the database table DOCUMENT. The content
of the document is stored as a string in a CLOB.
The database table contains a couple of additional columns
for querying and life cycle handling. Their values are not
essential for work flow execution but are needed for querying,
cleaning up and archiving purposes. These fields include
<ul>
  <li>Owner type. This can be one of the following:
     <ul>
     	<li>VARIABLE_INSTANCE. The document is created for a variable
     		instance.</li>
     	<li>LISTENER_REQUEST. The document is used to store
     		a message received by a listener from an external system.</li>
     	<li>LISTENER_RESPONSE. The response message sent
     		to the external system from which the listener received
     		a message</li>
     	<li>ADAPTOR_REQUEST. The document is used to store
     		a message sent to an external system via an adaptor
     		activity.</li>
     	<li>ADAPTOR_RESPONSE. The document is used to store
     		the synchronous response message received from an external system to
     		which the adaptor activity has sent a message.</li>
     </ul></li>
  <li>Owner ID. The ID of the owner (with respect to the corresponding
  		owner type).</li>
  <li>Process instance ID. The process instance ID of the owner
  		activity instance or variable. For documents owned by
  		external events, the field contains the ID of the process
  		instance the message is to be delivered to, or 0 if 
  		such information is not available.</li>
  <li>Type. The same as variable type. For documents that
  		are not owned by variable instances, you should also
  		set it to an appropriate variable type, because the
  		document may be bound to variables later on.</li>
  <li>Search key 1 and 2. These 2 fields are provided for speeding
        up common queries specific to the type of documents.
        For instance, you can use one of the field to store
        BTN of service orders so that we can search on BTN for the 
        documents. These fields are not used by MDW Framework
        code itself. It is the application's responsibility to
        ensure the values of the fields are consistent with
        the content of the document.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessing Documents in Activity Implementors</h2>
Variables bound to documents are actually taking objects of the class
<code>DocumentReference</code>, which contains basically an ID for the document
in the database table DOCUMENT.
The methods mentioned above all perform on the objects of
this class. The additional methods are used
to access the actual objects (instead of the reference objects).
<p>
Here is an example for retrieving the document from variable:
<pre>
    DocumentReference docref = (DocumentReference)this.getParameterValue("my_variable_name");
    Object doc = this.getDocument(docref);
</pre>
The following example shows how to create a new document
and bind it to a variable:
<pre>
    Object doc;		// your object type, such as XmlObject
    String varType;		// the variable type
    DocumentReference docref = this.createDocument(varType, doc, OwnerType.VARIABLE_REFERENCE, new Long(0));
    Long varInstId = this.setParameterValue(name, docref);
    this.updateDocumentInfo(docref, null, null, null, varInstId, null, null);
</pre>
The following is an example for updating the document referenced by the variable:
<pre>
    Object doc;		// your object with updated value
    DocumentReference docref = (DocumentReference)this.getParameterValue("my_variable_name");
    this.updateDocument(docref, doc);
</pre>
Indeed there is a simpler way to perform the above two functions:
<pre>
    this.setParameterValueAsDocument(varName, varType, doc);
</pre>
This creates the document and binds the variable instance with
the document reference if the variable is not yet bound,
or updates the document the variable instances references
when the variable is already bound to a document reference.
<p>
The following method determines if a variable
type is a document variable:
<pre>
   if (VariableTranslator.isDocumentReferenceVariable(varType)) {
       ... ...
   }
</pre>

<h2>Remote Document</h2>
MDW allows documents stored in one MDW application
be accessed by another. The references to the documents
are passed through remote process invocation or other
means to other applications. The <code>DocumentReference</code>
objects contain a server field referring to the owning
application. The field is null for local document.
<p>
Remote documents are accessed in a similar way
as local documents. We note there are following differences:
<ul>
   <li>Remote documents are read-only - cannot be updated.</li>
   <li>When a local document reference variable is passed
      to a remote process, MDW automatically converts it
      to a remote document reference for the invoked process
      instance. Similarly, if a document reference is returned
      by a remote process back to the calling process,
      the reference is updated automatically according to
      the location of the document</li>
   <li>You will need to configure the mapping from the logical
      server name to physical locations in order to access
      the documents. Refer to <a href='InvokeSubProcessActivity.html'>
      this link</a> for how to configure the mapping.</li> 
</ul>
Because MDW automatically converts between local and remote
document references during remote process invocation and return
from it, you do not need to create remote document reference
directly. In case you want to use remote document reference
in other context, the second argument of the constructor
for DocumentReference is used to specify the logical server name.
<p>
By using remote document references, we can avoid passing large
documents between different work flow applications.
<p>
To check if a document reference object refers to a remote
document, use
<pre>
    if (documentReference.getServer()!=null) ... ...
</pre>


<h2>Variable Access in External Event Handlers</h2>

To be completed.

<h2>Add Variable Types</h2>
The built-in variable types should be sufficient for use in most cases,
as they include XML DOM document and XML Beans.
Since we are not encouraging adding custom variable types, the designer
does not include an interface to create, modify or delete variable types.
<p>
If there is a good reason to add an additional type, you need to 
insert an entry in the database table VARIABLE_TYPE, as in
<pre>
  insert into variable_type values (501, 'org.apache.xmlbeans.XmlObject', sysdate, 
     'cuid', '', '', '', 
     'com.centurylink.mdw.common.translator.impl.XmlBeanTranslator');
</pre>
where 3 values are significant:
<ul>
  <li>ID. This is the first argument. The value does not matter as long as it is 
      different from any existing entry.</li>
  <li>Type name (second argument). Although not required, it is customarily the class name
      of the object the variable is dealing with.</li>
  <li>Translator class name (last argument). This is a class to provide
      translation between the objects and their serialized form (String) in database.
      More than likely you will use a document reference translator.</li>
</ul>
You will need to implement a variable translator.
A variable translator class must extend the abstract class
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.common.translator.VariableTranslator</code>.
Indeed, since the new type you are adding is likely non-primitive, we require
custom variable types to be implemented as documents,
which requires your translator to extend the abstract class
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.common.translator.DocumentReferenceTranslator</code>,
which you will need to implement two methods: <code>realToString</code> and <code>realToObject</code>.
