<h1>Using Activity Implementor JMS Adapter</h1>

The class <code>
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/adapter/jms/JmsAdapter.html">
com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.adapter.jms.JmsAdapter</a></code>
implements an adapter activity that can be used to send JMS messages.
The adapter is intended for both asynchronous messages (sending messages only - using
another event wait activity to receive the responses if they are expected) 
and synchronous messages (sending messages and waiting for responses in the same
activity).
<p>
The adapter also implements so-called <em>certified messages</em>, which are asynchronous
messages but MDW guarantees their delivery. We will cover this in more detail.


<h2>Attributes</h2>
The following attributes are used by this implementor:

<ul>
  <li>Request Variable. This is a variable name. The request message sent to external
      system is taken from the value of this variable.</li>
  <li>Response Variable. This is a variable name that will receive the response message,
      when the adapter is synchronous (Wait for response is true). It is ignored when
      the adapter is asynchronous.</li>
  <li>Wait for response. When it is true, the adapter is synchronous, meaning it is waiting
      for a response; when it is false, the adapter is asynchronous, meaning it sends the message
      and moves on to the next activity. The third option is Certified (available since MDW 4.5
      and MDW 5.1), which is asynchronous as well, but the message delivery is guaranteed (more
      detail will be covered in the next section).</li>
  <li>Log req/resp. This is a Boolean flag to turn on or off logging of messages
  	  to and from the external systems. The messages are logged in the database table
  	  ADAPTER_INSTANCE (will be moved to DOCUMENT in future releases).</li>
  <li>Server URL. This attribute specifies the URL of the receiving (remote) JNDI server.
      An example is <code>tcp://localhost:7001</code>. More than likely, the value is
      deployment specific (different between development, testing and production environment).
      So it is typically specified using properties using the MDW <a href="bindingExpressions.html">binding expressions</a> syntax 
      <code>#{props['my.jms.url']}</code>.</li>
  <li>Queue Name. This specifies the receiving (remote) queue name. For certified
  	  messages, the receiving queue must implement MDW acknowledgment protocol (see
  	  more detail in the next section)</li>
  <li>Reply Queue Name. This specifies a local queue name to receive the response.
      When the adapter is synchronous (Wait for response is true), this is typically
      left blank, and the engine will generate a temporary queue to recevie the response.
      When the adapter is asynchronous or certified, meaning a wait activity later on will wail for
      the response, this should typically be 
      the external event queue (named <code>com.centurylink.mdw.external.event.queue</code>)
      so that the standard listener and external event handler mechanism can be used.
      If an application specific JMS queue is needed, the handling of the response messages
      will be completely up to the application specific code.</li>
  <li>Correlation ID. If an asynchronous response is expected, or the message is an asynchronous response
      to an asynchronous external message, the correlation ID may need to be specified.
      The value of the attribute allows to contain place holders for dynamic contents.
      The syntax for place holder is a "$" and a variable name enclosed in braces ("{" and "}"),
	  such as <code>{$my_variable_1}</code>. Besides process variables, the following variable names
	have predefined meanings:
	<table>
 	 <tr><td>{$ProcessInstanceID}</td><td>Has the value of the process instance ID</td></tr>
 	 <tr><td>{$MasterRequestID}</td><td>Has the value of the master request ID</td></tr>
 	 <tr><td>{$ActivityInstanceID}</td><td>Has the value of the activity instance ID</td></tr>
	</table>
	</li>
  <li>Message XSD. This is for documentation purpose only. If a valid URL is specified,
      you can open the XSD directly from the designer by clicking the "Open Link" button 
      on the right side of the attribute specification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Certified Messages</h2>
Certified messages are asynchronous (one-way) messages with guaranteed delivery,
and are implemented since MDW 5.1 and also ported to MDW 4.5.
The mechanism is implemented through a demon which resends messages for which
earlier delivery failed. The receiver also needs to be aware of certified messages,
for which an MDW-defined internal acknowledgment must be sent back to the 
sender, and must guarantee only one message is processed when it receives multiple
copies (this can happen when the acknowledgment fails to reach the sender, which
resends the message without having received an acknowledgment). 
<p>
Certified messages relieves the applications from implementing their own
retrying logic after failures, thereby simplifies much of the code logic and
exception handling, as most of time the developers and AIPs do not even need
to worry about whether the messages are actually delivered. There are some rare
occasions (e.g. the receiver machine is permanently down, say as a result
of hardware failure), so we cover below the internal implementation for managing
these type of situations. Understanding the implementation may also help trouble
shooting, because message delivery certificates are persisted so you can use that
to find out if and when the messages are sent and received.
<p>
When a certified message is to be delivered, MDW records the message content
in the DOCUMENT table (as with all adapter messages), and also a row
in the table EVENT_INSTANCE with the following data
<ul>
  <li>EVENT_NAME: this is a unique <em>certified message ID</em> in the form of
  		<code>MDWCM-<var>appname</var>-<var>documentid</var></code>,
  		where <var>appname</var> is the application name as configured
  		in MDW properties, and <var>documentid</var> is the ID of the
  		document storing the request message.</li>
  <li>DOCUMENT_ID: this is again the ID of the request document.</li>
  <li>STATUS_CD: always 6 (EventInstanceVO.STATUS_CERTIFIED_MESSAGE)
  		for certified messages</li>
  <li>CREATE_DT: time when the message is requested to be sent</li>
  <li>CONSUME_DT: time when the message is known to be delivered.
  		When it is null, it means the message is not known to be delivered yet</li>
  <li>AUXDATA: this stores configuration parameters
  	    such as JNDI URL and the queue name of receiver.</li>
  <li>REFERENCE: this is used for identifying the association
  		of the message, such as the process/activity instance IDs
  		of the activity sending the message. It is for display 
  		in the event management GUI only and plays no role in functionality</li>
</ul>
MDW will also inform its internal demon (CertifiedMessageManager), which handles
delivery, re-send and certification of certified messages, about this new request.
In case of failure, the demon resends the message every 600 seconds
(10 minutes) by default, which can be changed by setting the property
<code>mdw.certified_message.RetryInterval</code> (unit is second).
The demon buffers all undelivered messages in memory and checks
by default every 60 seconds if there are any messages that need
to be resent, hence the actual redelivery may happen between 300 and 360 seconds.
The 60 seconds check interval can be altered by setting the 
property <code>mdw.certified_message.CheckInterval</code>.
For each delivery try (original or redelivery), the demon times out
by default 15 seconds in waiting for the acknowledgment, and the timeout value
can be altered by setting the property <code>mdw.certified_message.AcknowlegmentTimeout</code>.
<p>
On the receiving side, two MDW queues, external event queue
(com.centurylink.mdw.external.event.queue) has implemented
MDW certified messaging protocol (the latter is for MDW internal usage).
For certified messages, the sender sets the JMS correlation ID to the certified message
ID, which has the special prefix <code>MDWCM-</code>. The receiver
recognizes certified messages by checking for this prefix, and sends
back a response whose content is just this certified message ID as the 
acknowledgment. The receiver also creates an entry in EVENT_INSTANCE table
(note this is on a different database) as the certificate of having received
the message, with the following entries:
<ul>
  <li>EVENT_NAME: the certified message ID as received from the sender</li>
  <li>DOCUMENT_ID: not used</li>
  <li>STATUS_CD: always 6 (EventInstanceVO.STATUS_CERTIFIED_MESSAGE)
  		for certified messages</li>
  <li>CREATE_DT: not used, filled with the current system time</li>
  <li>CONSUME_DT: time when the message is received.</li>
  <li>COMMENTS: null</li>
</ul>
If the entry already exits, it means the message has been received previously,
and the receiver will not pass the message to event handlers again. It will,
however, still send the acknowledgment back to the sender.
<p>
When the sender application server is down, the demon at restart will
read in all messages from database that are not delivered yet (CONSUME_DT is null),
and start to manage them again, hence guarantees the messages will not get lost.
To avoid clogging the application server when it is just started, the demon
waits for 300 seconds by default before trying to redeliver messages. You can
override the delay by setting the property 
<code>mdw.certified_message.InitialDelay</code>.
<p>
In a clustered environment, every managed server has its own demon, each
loads all unsent messages from database at start, but the demon implementation
ensures that a message is only processed by one demon.
For performance consideration, demon only loads database entries at the start,
so new entries inserted by one managed server are not known to demons
in other managed servers until they restart.
This implies that if one managed server is down for extended time, 
then messages added during the life time of its last run and failed to deliver
will not be retried again until some managed server (does not have to be the downed one)
is restarted.

<h2>Extending the Implementor</h2>
