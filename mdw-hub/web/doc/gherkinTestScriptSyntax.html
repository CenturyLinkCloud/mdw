<h1>Gherkin Test Script Syntax</h1>

<p>The <a href="automatedTesting.html">MDW Automated Testing</a> facility supports <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin">Gherkin</a>
language feature files for use with the <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a> behavior-driven testing framework. 
This syntax makes it easy for business users to create and run automated test cases that exercise MDW workflow capabilities.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note:</span> To run Gherkin test cases in your workflow project you'll need to add the following
Maven or Gradle dependencies:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;dependency>
    &lt;groupId>info.cukes&lt;/groupId>
    &lt;artifactId>cucumber-java&lt;/artifactId>
    &lt;version>1.2.4&lt;/version>
    &lt;scope>test&lt;/scope>
  &lt;/dependency>
  &lt;dependency>
    &lt;groupId>info.cukes&lt;/groupId>
    &lt;artifactId>cucumber-groovy&lt;/artifactId>
    &lt;version>1.2.4&lt;/version>
    &lt;scope>test&lt;/scope>
  &lt;/dependency>
  &lt;dependency>
    &lt;groupId>com.centurylink.mdw&lt;/groupId>
    &lt;artifactId>mdw-designer-core&lt;/artifactId>
    &lt;version>8.6.0&lt;/version>
    &lt;scope>test&lt;/scope>
  &lt;/dependency>
  &lt;dependency>
    &lt;groupId>org.eclipse.jgit&lt;/groupId>
    &lt;artifactId>org.eclipse.jgit&lt;/artifactId>
    &lt;version>3.4.1.201406201815-r&lt;/version>
    &lt;scope>test&lt;/scope>
  &lt;/dependency>
</pre>
<p>The mdwdemo sample project illustrates the proper setup for executing Gherkin-syntax workflow tests.  This is available
in the MDW Git repository in CenturyLink Labs: https://8.22.8.164/mdw/mdwdemo.git</p>

<h3><a id="generalSemantics">General Semantics</a></h3>
<p>MDW automated tests use <a href="https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm">Cucumber JVM</a>; specifically, the 
<a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/groovy">Groovy Language</a> semantics.  This is relevant for the 
Cucumber steps definition (sometimes called glue).  When you first create a Gherkin test case in Designer, it generates a steps.groovy
file in the test cases directory of your project.  This file covers all the common scenarios described below, and it may be extended
to include less-common scenarios.  The Groovy code for each step has access to all the features of the standard MDW 
<a href="groovyTestScriptSyntax.html">Groovy Testing DSL</a>.</p> 

<p>STDOUT is directed to the test results execute.log file, and is also visible in Designer's Test Exec view output pane.
In steps.groovy, Standard Groovy variable substitutions are applied to double-quoted strings, so the following lines both display the master request id for a run:</p> 
<pre>
println "masterRequestId: " + masterRequestId
println "masterRequestId: ${masterRequestId}"
</pre>
<p>The context for variable substitutions is an instance of <a href="">DefaultTestCaseExec</a>, which is defined in steps.groovy.  
By default the master request id for the test is auto-generated, but you can assign it yourself as well.  
You can also use the standard Groovy <em>assert</em> keyword to check values and fail the test if some condition is not met:</p>
<pre>
// ensure a numeric master request id
masterRequestId = System.currentTimeMillis();
assert masterRequestId > 0
</pre>
<p> If you need to define your own master request id in feature file then you can follow following syntax
<pre>
Given masterRequestId "12345"
<br>or
<br>Given masterRequestId "$MyApp-{masterRequestId}"
</pre>

<h3><a id="launchProcess">Launch a Process</a></h3>
<p>One of the key functions of an MDW test is to run a workflow process and compare the outcome versus the expected
result.  This concept is explained in detail in the <a href="automatedTesting.html">automated testing documentation</a>.
The simplest way to start a process is like this:</p>
<pre>
When the "MyProcess" workflow is invoked</pre>
This kicks off the latest version of the process named <em>MyProcess</em> in any workflow package.
Frequently when launching a process you"ll want specify input variable values, which can be done this way:
<pre>
Given process input values:
      | customerId  | DHO115360          |
      | orderNumber | ${masterRequestId} |</pre>

<p>To read from a file, add the file to to test case directory and use following syntax:</p>
<pre>
Given process input values:
      | request  | ${file('GetEmployee.xml')} |</pre>
<h3><a id="sendMessage">Send a Message</a></h3>
<p>Another way to trigger your workflow is to send an event message:</p>
<pre>
When I send "${file('GetEmployeeRequest.xml')}"</pre>
<p>This sends a message to MDW with the contents of the specified file over the default REST protocol.
To send a message using another supported protocol use a form like this:</p>
<pre>
When I send "SOAP" message "${file('GetEmployeeRequest.xml')}"</pre>
<p>The SOAP protocol requires that the payload include a SOAP envelope element.
In either form, the raw message contents can contain dynamic values in the form
${myRequestPlaceholder}.  Standard Groovy expression evaluation is performed for these values.
The evaluation context is the same as described in 
<a href="testResultsFormat.html#dynamicValues">MDW Test Results Format</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="performTaskAction">Perform a Task Action</a></h3>
<p>For processes that include manual task activities, you can trigger a task action like so:</p>
<pre>
And I Claim task "Manual Acknowledgment"</pre>
<p>This assigns the manual task to the user executing the tests.  The <em>Claim</em> keyword indicates
the action to be performed on the task, which can be any standard or custom <a href="taskAction.html">Task Action</a>.</p>
<p>Completing a manual task frequently requires that input data be entered along with the action.  This can be 
accomplished using the <em>dataTable</em> input just like initializing input variables for a process:</p>
<pre>
And I Claim task "Manual Acknowledgment"<br>And I wait 10 seconds<br>And I Complete task "Manual Acknowledgment" with values:
      | acknowledged | true      | 
      | ackDate      | ${today}  | 
      | customerName | Don Oakes |</pre> 
      

<h3><a id="notifyWaitingProcesses">Notify Waiting Processes</a></h3>
<p>For test cases that need to notify waiting in-flight processes, the following syntax can be used:</p>
<pre>
Given I notify event "S-${masterRequestId}" with message "&lt;/EventCheck&gt;"</pre>
<p>The event ID parameter (to correlate with the waiting process instance) can embed the following
server-side placeholders, which will be substituted with the appropriate runtime values:
<code>${masterRequestId}</code>, <code>${processInstanceId}</code>, <code>${activityInstanceId}</code>,
<code>${&lt;variable_name&gt;}</code>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note:</span> Although the syntax looks the same as the general
variable substitution syntax, this special usage involves substitution on the server (the raw placeholders are passed
in Designer's message to the server, and substitution happens on that side).  In this usage, only the specific expressions
above are supported.  Unlike the general mechanism, your custom Groovy script bindings cannot be substituted.</p>   

<h3><a id="waitForProcessCompletion">Wait for Process Completion</a></h3>
<p>Before the process outcome can be compared against the expected results, the test execution
needs to wait for the process to be completed.  The simplest form of the <span class="cmd">wait</span> command is like this:</p>
<pre>
And I await process completion  
</pre>
<p>This waits for completion of the process most recently launched through the <span class="cmd">start</span> command, using the default timeout of 60 seconds.

<p>The <span class="cmd">wait</span> command tells process execution to pause for a designated period.  The syntax for sleep is very simple:</p>
<pre>
And I wait 20 seconds
</pre>
<h3><a id="verifyProcessResults">Verify Process Results</a></h3>
<p>This compares the expected results file versus the actual results for a process that was
started through either <em><a href="#launchProcess">start process</a></em> or <em><a href="#sendMessage">send message</a></em>.
These are stored as files, in the format described in <a href="testResultsFormat.html">MDW Test Results Format</a>
(this document also describes the Groovy expression mechanism for substituting dynamic values in expected results).
If the comparison show differences, the test case fails with a message identifying the line number of the first delta.</p>
<p>If a single process was launched using the <span class="cmd">start</span> command, the following simple form can be used:</p>
<pre>
Then the results should match "HandleOrder"</pre>

<p>There's a specific convention for embedded subprocesses like Exception Handlers.  If your test case involves
invoking an embedded subprocess, you should include that along with the parent process in a single <span class="cmd">verify</span> command:</p>
<pre>
Then the results should match "EventCheck, EventCheck Correction Handler"</pre>
<p>In this example the embedded subprocess for &quot;EventCheck&quot; appears as just "EventCheck Correction Handler&quot;.</p>

<h3><a id="verifyMessageResponse">Verify Message Response</a></h3>
<p>When a test case involves a <em><a href="#sendMessage">send message</a></em> step to a service process,
frequently success needs to be evaluated according to the contents of the response:</p>

<p>Usually it's handy to keep the expected response in a standalone file:</p>
<pre>
Then the response should match "${file('GetEmployeeResponse.xml')}"</pre>
<p>An easy way to initially populate the expected response is to run the test case once and copy/paste
the actual response from the Text Exec view console window.  In your expected response content you can 
embed dynamic expressions as described in <a href="testResultsFormat.html#dynamicValues">MDW Test Results Format</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="stubAdapterResponse">Stub an AdapterResponse</a></h3>
<p>If your test process involves an adapter activity, you may want to inject a stubbed response
to the adapter call so that the test doesn't depend on availability of an external system.
To inject a stubbed response based on an XPath test condition, use a snippet like this:
<pre>
And I stub "GetEmployee" after delay of 5 seconds with a response "${file('GetEmployeeResponse.xml')}"
</pre>
<p>This registers a stub handler to respond to any adapter whose request content is XML with a
"GetEmployee" root node (based on <a href="xpath.html">MDW XPath</a> evaluation), and set the response
to the contents of the file GetEmployeeResponse.xml.  <p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note:</span> For adapter stubbing to be applied, the
"Use Stubbing" checkbox must be selected on the test case launch dialog.</p>

<p>Multiple stub declarations can be included in a test case (before triggering any processes with the adapters you wish to
stub).  Stubs are consulted in the order they were declared.  If no matching stub is encountered
for an adapter, then it will be invoked according to its design attributes.</p>


<h4><a id="stubSubstitutions">Stub Substitutions</a></h4>
<p>Expressions in the stubbed response are automatically processed using Groovy variable substitutions.  So, for
example, the following stub response in EmployeeLookupResponse.xml will contain the actual master request ID at runtime:</p>
<pre>
&lt;EmployeeLookupResponse>
  &lt;masterRequestId>${masterRequestId}&lt;/masterRequestId>
  &lt;name>Donald Oakes&lt;/name>
&lt;/EmployeeLookupResponse>
</pre>

<p>A common scenario requires including some values from the request in the response.  In that case you can make use
of the implicit <em>request</em> variable, and assign response values using GPath expressions:</p>
<pre>
&lt;EmployeeLookupResponse>
  &lt;masterRequestId>${masterRequestId}&lt;/masterRequestId>
  &lt;workstationId>${request.userId}&lt;/workstationId>
  &lt;name>Donald Oakes&lt;/name>
&lt;/EmployeeLookupResponse>
</pre>
