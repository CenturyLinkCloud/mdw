<h1>Composite Synchronous Adapter Activities</h1>

<p>It is a frequent pattern that we simulate a synchronous call to an external system
with using a pair of asynchronous messages, one for the request and the other for the response.
There are also cases where we would like to use synchronous protocols such
as web service call to send a request and receive an acknowledgment right away, and
then use another message (using same or different protocols) to get the real response
later on.</p>

<p>The out-of-box MDW adapters for asynchronous message protocols such
as JMS, WebSphere MQ and Tibco BUS can simulate synchronous calls using mechanisms
supported by the underlying protocols (such as temporary response queues for
JMS and MQ, request-reply mode of CenturyLink-built Bus Connectors).
The composite synchronous adapter activities we are covering here supports
more general types of synchronous calls using two messages, such as using
web service for requests and acknowledgments, and using Tibco bus to receive
responses.</p>

<p>MDW provides an abstract base class,
 <code>com.centurylink.mdw.workflow.adapter.CompositeSynchronousAdapterBase</code>,
to serve as the base of any composite synchronous adapters. The class
extends <code>PoolableAdapterBase</code> and also implements <code>SuspendibleActivity</code>,
so it can be roughly viewed as a combination of an adapter activity for sending requests and
an event wait activity for receiving responses.  Out of box we also provide
one concrete subclass, <code>CompositeWebServiceAdapter</code>, that supports
using MDW WebService as the protocol for sending requests. 
We note that the responses are to be received through the listener/event handler mechanisms, so
the composite adapters themselves only need to deal with request protocols but not
response protocols.</p>

<p><code>CompositeWebServiceAdapter</code> can server as a code example for building
your own composite synchronous adapters.
The methods you are required to implement or commonly be overridden are
mostly the same as those for (simple) adapters, and please refer
to <a href="AdapterActivityBase.html">Using Adapter Activities</a> for the documentation.
The following describes some of the differences and additions:</p>

<ul>
<li>All methods in the super class applies the request sending part.
Where <em>response</em> is mentioned, it really refers to the acknowledgment,
examples are methods <code>getTimeoutForResponse</code>, <code>onSuccess</code>, etc.
</li>

<li>The method <code>canBeSynchronous()</code> is finalized and always
returns true, and the method <code>canBeAsynchronous()</code> is finalized
and always returns false.
</li>

<li>A new overridable method <code>boolean processResponse(String responseMessage)</code>
is provided so that custom business logic can be implemented when
receiving response messages. The default method binds the response message 
to the response variable if it is configured, and it returns true.
<p>When the method returns true, the engine will complete the activity and move on.
By default, the transition is determined based on the completion code specified
in the event wait registration. You can override that by using the method
<code>this.setReturnCode()</code>.</p>
<p>If the method returns false, the activity will keep waiting for additional messages.
The work flow does not transition away and the completion code is ignored.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The following attributes are defined in the base class and should be typically
included in its subclasses, which typically add request protocol specific attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Request Variable</code>: specifies a variable that holds the request message</li>
<li><code>Response Variable</code>: specifies a variable that holds the response message</li>
<li><code>Log req/resp</code>: a boolean value indicating whether the request and 
	response messages should be logged in the document table</li>
<li><code>Events</code>: configure events that are to be listened for receiving
    responses. You must configure this attribute for receiving responses.
    See <a href='EventWaitActivity.html'>Event Wait Activity</a> documentation for its usage.</li>
<li><code>Max tries</code>: maximum number of retries plus one (the original try) in case of 
		connection failures when sending request messages. Cannot be used in service processes.</li>
<li><code>Retry Interval (sec)</code>: number of seconds till the next retries.</li>
<li><code>Acknowledgment Timeout (sec)</code>: timeout in seconds for getting acknowledgment
    after sending requests.
    Only applicable for synchronous protocols such as web services</li>
<li><code>Response Timeout (sec)</code>: timeout in seconds for waiting for responses.</li>
<li><code>Status after timeout</code>: the activity status after timeout. 
 See <a href='EventWaitActivity.html'>Event Wait Activity</a> documentation for its description.</li>
<li><code>Request XSD</code>: a URL pointing to the XSD or other documentation for request messages.
	This is for documentation purpose only and is ignored by runtime engine</li>
<li><code>Response XSD</code>: a URL pointing to the XSD or other documentation for response messages.
	This is for documentation purpose only and is ignored by runtime engine</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Composite Synchronous Adapters in Service Processes</h2>

<p>A service process is executed in a single thread, hence it typically
cannot handle asynchronous responses using event wait activities.
For composite synchronous adapters, MDW internally implements some special
logic to allow them be used in service processes. 
Rather than using standard event registration mechanism, the adapter waits
for messages synchronously within the <code>execute</code> method 
of the activities (namely waiting within the thread). The standard
listeners are still used to receive responses, but a special external
event handler class needs to be configured to notify waiting threads: 
<code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.NotifySynchronousAdapterHandler</code>, as in the sample
event handler specification:</p>
<pre>
com.centurylink.mdw.listener.NotifySynchronousAdapterHandler?EventName=TestEvent-{//MasterRequestId}
</pre>
<p>The events here are not registered in the typical place (database tables <code>EVENT_INSTANCE</code>
and <code>EVENT_WAIT_INSTANCE</code>), rather in some memory data structure, and this special
event handler knows where to find the special event registrations and notifies waiting threads.</p>

<p>In summary, the following are main differences when using the adapters inside service processes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Event registrations are implemented in a special way in memory
      so you will not find them in database tables</li>
  <li>You must use <code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.NotifySynchronousAdapterHandler</code> or custom
      event handlers extending this class and invokes its method <code>notifyWaitingThread</code>
      to notify waiting threads.</li>
  <li>Automatic retries are not supported, so you cannot configure attributes such as <code>Max tries</code>.</li>
  <li>The return value of <code>processResponse()</code> is ignored and treated as true, namely
      it can expect exactly one response message (regular processes can handle multiple response messages
      for a single request).</li>
  <li>In case of timeout while waiting for responses, the adapters simply throw an
  	  <code>ActivityException</code> (which should typically be caught by the event handler
  	  starting the service processes), rather than following <code>DELAY</code> transitions as for
  	  regular processes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stubbing</h2>
<p>For regular processes, the stubbed response replaces acknowledgment, not
the real responses. You will need to send an external event to emulate the real
responses.
For service processes, the stubbed response replaces the real responses.
If you override <code>onSuccess()</code> method to process acknowledgment,
be sure to call <code>super.onSuccess()</code> first, otherwise the stub response
will be null.</p>
