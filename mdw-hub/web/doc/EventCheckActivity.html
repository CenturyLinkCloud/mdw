<h1>Using Activity Implementor EventCheckActivity</h1>
This activity is quite similar to <a href="EventWaitActivity.html">Event Wait Activity</a>
<br>There are two differences
<ul>
  <li>If there are no pre-arrived events then activity simply moves to complete status and process moves forward. </li>
  <li>This implementor is used to check for pre-arrived external, solicited or unsolicited events and if there are any event then it would react to those event like 
Event Wait activity but the difference here is that after processing the event it goes to complete status. If there are multiple event then it will complete  after 
processing all the un-handled messages. It would also handle any event which arrived while it was processing a previous event in one of the embedded process handler.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Processing Events</h2>
Following table  describes how this activity  is different from EventWaitActivity, if there is a pre-arrived event before this activity instance is created.<br><table
			width="100%" >
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Completion Code</th>
					<th style="width: 264px;">Recurring Flag</th>
					<th>Outcome</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tr>
				<td>Hold::CORRECT</td>
				<td>Yes</td>
				<td>Activity goes into Hold status and transition is made to correction handler. Since it is recurring it will cancel all the waits with the similar registration. You cannot have Hold status for a non-recurring event. Advantage of doing this is that while in Hold status it will still register any event which came during its handling of previous event in correction handler. Final status of the activity would be Completed.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Completed::CORRECT</td>
				<td>No</td>
				<td>Activity instance moves to Completed status and transition is made to correction handler. After the correction handler is complete the activity would get completed and process will move forward.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Cancelled::ABORT</td>
              <td>No</td>
              <td>Activity instance moves to Cancelled  status and transition is made to Cancellation handler. After the cancellation handler is complete the process would move to Cancelled state.</td>
            </tr>
