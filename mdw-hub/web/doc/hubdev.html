<h1>MDWHub Development</h1>

The MDWHub webapp provides user functionality for handling fallout and other manual tasks, as well as standard workload management, 
reporting and administration capabilities.  MDWHub is implemented using JavaServer Faces (a JavaEE standard component technology).
This approach allows a highly flexible configuration-driven interface based on reusable JSF components.
<br/><br/>
MDWHub can be customized in a number of different ways, depending on the degree of flexibility required.  
The first part of this document describes the most basic customizations that can be performed, such as adding new columns to a list by editing 
the mdw-hub-view.xml config file.  The easiest way to customize this file is to create a package called (by convention) MDWHub and copy in the standard
version from the com.centurylink.mdw.hub package.  Workflow apps can also build a more sophisticated custom web UI that extends and enhances the capabilities 
provided in the framework, with a custom look-and-feel.  This approach is described under the <a href="customWeb.html">Custom Web</a> section.
<br/><br/>
There are many built-in components included in the MDW Framework which are assembled into the highest-level UI components (lists, filters, details, charts, etc).
The same implementation is leveraged for every instance of these high-level components, and their arrangement is specified in mdw-hub-view.xml.  
The following entry illustrates the properties of the My Tasks lists in mdw-hub-view.xml:

<pre>
&lt;list
  id="userTaskList"
  name="My Tasks"
  model="com.centurylink.mdw.taskmgr.ui.tasks.list.UserTasks"
  filter="userTasksFilter"
  controller="com.centurylink.mdw.taskmgr.ui.tasks.list.TaskListActionController"
  defaultSortColumn="Task ID"
  displayRows="20"&gt;
  &lt;column
    name=""
    attribute="selected"
    checkbox="true" /&gt;
  &lt;column
    name="Task ID"
    attribute="instanceId"
    linkAction="taskDetail" /&gt;
  &lt;column
    name="Category"
    attribute="categoryCode" /&gt;
 ...

&lt;/list>
</pre>
This snippet shows how to spell out the configuration for a sortable list using the framework.  The id attribute of the list element is simply a unique identifier referenced in the ListManager getter for the list.  The name attribute defines the display name for the list.  The model attribute points to a Java class which must implement a retrieveItems method to populate the list with a collection of ListItem model objects (which typically wrap an object defined in our data model).  The controller points to a class which implements the ListActionController interface and governs how the list responds to events such as when a link is clicked inside a row.  Other attributes perform functions that are relatively self-explanatory.

Within the list are a number of column elements which specify data fields that are to be displayed as column values in the list.  Columns can be added, removed and rearranged dynamically as long as the appropriate getter method is defined in your model implementation.

The "My Tasks" list in this example is used in the myTasks.xhtml facelet file as follows:
<pre>
&lt;ui:define name="list"&gt;
  &lt;q:list
    id="myTasksList"
    listId="myTasks"
    listEntity="#{listManager.myTasks}"
    label="My Tasks (#{authenticatedUser.cuid})" /&gt;
&lt;/ui:define>
</pre>
<p>
The glue that ties together the mdw-hub-view.xml list definition with the facelet file is the <a href="bindingExpressions.html">expression language</a> syntax: #{listManager.myTasks}.  
The method getMyTasks() in ListManager.java returns the list constructed according to the "userTaskList" in TaskView.xml.  
The myTasks.xhtml facelets file also includes a filter to narrow the contents displayed in the list, as well as a taskAction component which enables 
actions to be performed on list items.  The layout of these components is governed by the filteredList.xhtml template specified at the top of myTasks.xhtml.
<p>
The individual pages (as defined in facelets files such as myTasks.xhtml) are displayed in a tabbed arrangement controlled by the
main layout file (typically main.xhtml).  This file includes a number of <q:tab> components inside of a <q:tabbedPage> component.  
Each tab component has an action attribute indicating the action to be performed whenever the tab is clicked.  
These actions correspond to JSF navigation outcomes defined in your faces-config.xml descriptor file 
(the framework navigation outcomes and managed beans are inherited from a separate faces-config.xml file embedded in the mdwhub.jar file).  
The tabs may also specify the rolesNeeded attribute which dictates which roles a user must belong to in order for the tab to be visible.
<p>
In general many of the components and much of the behavior of Task Manager are inherited from the framework but may be overridden.  
However, some files are purposely duplicated for each project instance.  
These files include the top-level facelet files as well as the stylesheets, menus and layout files.  
Individual Task Manager implementations may customize these files to easily control the look-and-feel of the application.
<p>
If you are developing in the Eclipse IDE and you have performed the JSF/Facelets support setup steps outlined in the 
<a href="http://cshare.ad.qintra.com/sites/MDW/Developer%20Resources/MDW5_Dev_Startup_Guide.doc">MDW Startup Guide</a>, 
you should be able to get autocomplete and syntax help when editing facelets files.  
The syntax help provides documentation for the components available for building your facelets.  
The autocomplete suggests component names as well as managed beans to be used in your expression language constructs.  
These functions are available for CenturyLink-developed components as well as the baseline JSF components built in to the implementation.
