<h1>Magic Box Rule Language Conditions and Expressions</h1>
<hr>
<p>Magic Box is an expert system engine 
with a rule language specialized for processing service orders
<cite>(with United States Patent 6,493,694)</cite> and it is proven to be useful
in handling other tree structured documents such as XML and JSON, as
it offers a good balance between express power and 
simplicity as well as conciseness ()
MDW embeds a version of the Magic Box engine for various purposes.
The most commonly used features of the Magic Box rule language within
MDW applications are its expressions and conditions. This documentation
describes only the relevant portion of the rule language with many examples
to help casual users to start easily. The documentation
for the full language, the engine and the other features
can be found from <a href="http://cshare.ad.qintra.com/sites/MDW/Previous%20Documents/mbengdoc/introduction.html">here.</a></p>

<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

<p>Magic Box language is a document processing language, and a typical Magic Box session
involves processing one or more documents. The documents it can process
can be hierarchical, such as XML documents, JSON documents and USO service orders,
or tabular, such as data contained in a database table or a hash table. With MDW
the Magic Engine is mainly used to handle hierarchical documents, so this quick
introduction document will not cover tabular documents.</p>
<p>Let us start by introducing some common concepts that are referenced
in various places. We will use the following sample XML document in the examples:</p>
<pre>
&lt;ServiceOrder&gt;
  &lt;DueDate&gt;2011-11-11&lt;/DueDate&gt;
  &lt;Billing&gt;
    &lt;Address&gt;
      &lt;Street&gt;2833 Quick Lane&lt;/Street&gt;
      &lt;City&gt;Denver&lt;/City&gt;
    &lt;/Address&gt;
  &lt;/Billing&gt;
  &lt;Services&gt;
    &lt;Line action="add"&gt;
      &lt;TN&gt;303 662-4545&lt;/TN&gt;
      &lt;VoiceMail&gt;English&lt;/TN&gt;
      &lt;CallForwardingNumber&gt;303 662-0001&lt;/TN&gt;
    &lt;/Line&gt;
    &lt;Line action="change"&gt;
      &lt;TN&gt;303 662-7261&lt;/TN&gt;
    &lt;/Line&gt;
    &lt;DSL action="recap"&gt;
      &lt;DN&gt;303 662-7091&lt;/DN&gt;
      &lt;ISP&gt;MSN&lt;/ISP&gt;
    &lt;/DSL&gt;
  &lt;/Services&gt;
&lt;/ServiceOrder&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Document and Global Variables</h4>
<p>The high level objects the Magic Box engine deals with
are <em>document variables</em> and <em>global variables</em>.
Both have the same syntax, which is a dollar sign followed by an
identifier (made of letters, numbers and "_"), such as <code>$ORDER</code>
and <code>$ServiceOrderNumber</code>. The difference only lies
what types of values they are bound to: a document variable is 
bound to a document, whereas a global variable is bound to a simple string as value.
<cite>(Magic Box also supports tables and sets
as values but those are not used under MDW context)</cite>.</p>

<p>Within MDW context, document and global variables are typically predefined
and bound to values that are natural in the context. For example,
when the language is used as scripts for implementing script activities
or used as expressions in defining smart attributes for activities,
the process variables are automatically treated as Magic Box document and global variables.</p>
<p>When the Magic Box session involves only one document variable, the special syntax <code>$$</code>
can be used to refer to this document variable <cite>(we will see later that even this 
short hand can be omitted entirely)</cite>. This is the case
when the language is used as expressions and conditions for
place holders in an HTML form, which is the sole document variable. It is also
the case when the language is used as expressions in the filters of
MDW automated tester, where <code>$$</code>
is bound to the request XML/JSON message (or other referenced documentation)
from which the values are taken from.</p>

<h4>Local Variables</h4>
Local variables are used to temporarily hold values such
as the result of computation. Within MDW context,
local variables are used in very limited areas, mainly
in existential conditions and pattern matchings (all to be covered later).
Syntactically, a local variable is just an identifier
(like global variables but without leading dollar signs),
such as <code>myVar</code>.
Local variables can be bound to strings or nodes as values.

<h4>Node References</h4>

<p>In Magic Box terminology, elements within a tree-structured
document are called <em>nodes</em> and the syntactic elements for specifying
nodes are called <em>node references</em>.
A node reference is composed of a global variable (
must be bound to a document) or a local variable (must be bound to
a node within a document)
followed by 1 or more subnode names delimited by dots, as in</p>
<pre>
    $ORDER.DueDate
    $ORDER.Billing.Address.City
    line.TN
</pre>
<p>When Magic Box session is used in the single document mode, the document
variable <code>$ORDER</code> can be replaced by <code>$$</code>; furthermore,
if the language is used in the context of simple expression and conditions
where local variables are not used, we can even omit <code>$$.</code> part,
as shown below:</p>
<pre>
    $$.DueDate
    DueDate
    $$.Billing.Address.City
    Billing.Address.City
</pre>

<h4>Constants</h4>

Strings and numbers. Examples:
The 
<pre>
    "1001 DISCOVERY DR."
     125
</pre>
Note internally numbers are also represented as strings,
so <code>125</code> and <code>"125"</code> are indeed the same.



<h4>Node Attribute References</h4>
<p>Both service orders and XML documents allow
to associate attributes to their nodes, in addition to
organizing nodes in a tree fashion.</p>

<p>Attributes of nodes can be referenced
by the syntax <samp><var>nodeexpr</var>:<var>attrname</var></samp>,
where <var>nodeexpr</var> is a node reference, a local variable bound
to a node, a document reference, or a table reference.
The special attribute <samp>&amp;</samp> is
used to represent the name of the node. For example,
<samp>&amp;$ORDER</samp> represent the root tag name of 
an XML document if the variable is bound to one.
<cite>Two other special attributes, # and @, are also supported, 
but they are not used in MDW environments.</cite>.
The following are some examples:</p>
<pre>
    $ORDER.Services.DSL:action
    line:action <cite>assuming line is a local variable bound to a "Line" in the order</cite>
    &line <cite>if line is a local variable bound to a line in the order, this has the value "Line"</cite>
    &$ORDER <cite>this represents the name of the root element, namely "ServiceOrder"</cite>
</pre>

<h4>Value Patterns</h4>
<p>Value patterns is useful in a number of places
for matching values. Magic Box implements
the standard regular expressions for this purpose.
There are two important differences, though,
in the Magic Box Engine implementation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Magic Box Engine pattern by default matches the whole string,
     whereas standard regular expression matches any
     substring. The difference is not a significant one,
     as you can match whole string in standard regular
     expression by prepending the pattern with a <code>^</code>
     and appending a <code>$</code>, and you can match a
     partial string in Magic Box Engine  by prepending and appending
     <code>.*</code>. The choice is made in Magic Box Engine  because
     matching whole string is a much common need.
     As a result, the characters <code>^</code> and <code>$</code>
     lose their special meaning in Magic Box Engine  regular expressions.</li>
  <li>Binding subpattern to local variables are achieved
     through the special syntax <code>(...){<var>var</var>}</code>,
     as in the following example:
<pre>
     $ORDER.Billing.Address.Street like "(\d+){streetNumber} .*"
</pre>
     The pattern finds the street number and binds it to local
     variable <code>streetNumber</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Node Reference Patterns</h4>

<p>Node reference patterns are used to select nodes from documents,
much like what XPath is designed to do.
Syntactically, a node reference pattern is composed of a global variable (
must be bound to a document) or a local variable (must be bound to
a node within a document)
followed by 1 or more node name pattern delimited by dots, and a node name pattern
can be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an actual name, e.g. <code>$ORDER.<em>Billing</em></code>;</li>
  <li>a set of names (a list of names separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets), 
  		e.g. <code>$ORDER.Services.<em>[Line,DSL]</em></code>;</li>
  <li>a value pattern enclosed in double quotes, e.g. <code>$$.Services.<em>"Line|DSL"</em>.TN</code>;</li>
  <li>attribute selector, in the form of attribute name-value pairs, as in the example
  		<code>$MyOrder.Services.<em>[action="add"]</em>.TN</code>.</li>
</ul>

Examples:
<pre>
    $ORDER.Billing.Address.[Street,City]
    billing."Street|City"
    $ORDER.Services.".*".TN
    $$.Services.[action="change"].TN
</pre>

<h2>Expressions</h2>

An expression generates a string value
as the result of computation. <cite>In full Magic Box language, an expression
can also generate nodes as values.</cite>

The following description defines what an expression can be:
<ul>
  <li>A (string or number) constant, such as <code>"New York"</code> and <code>125</code></li>
  <li>A global variable, such as <code>$REGION</code>. This syntax
  		is very often used to access process variables in MDW.</li>
  <li>A local variable, such as <code>line</code></li>
  <li>A node reference, such as <code>$ORDER.DueDate</code></li>
  <li>Node attribute references including those using "&amp;", such as
  		<code>line:TN</code> and <code>&$$</code>. 
		For a node in XML document, the name is the tag of the corresponding element.
		For a node in JSON document, the name is the same as what JSON considers a name.
  		</li>
  <li>A function call, which has a function name
     with a list of arguments, each of which is an expression, more details covered below</li>
     
  <li>A conditional expression of the form
	<code>([<var>cond<sub>1</sub></var>]<var>expr<sub>1</sub></var>;
		[<var>cond<sub>2</sub></var>]<var>expr<sub>2</sub></var>;
		... ...;
		<var>expr<sub>n</sub></var>)</code>, more details covered below.</li>
  <li>Any expression (primitive or not) enclosed in parentheses</li>
</ul>

<h4>Values for node reference and variables bound to nodes</h4>
When a string value is expected, a node reference is evaluated
to its value. For a node in XML documents, the value is the direct text
contained in the element, and empty string if the element contains only
sub elements or nothing at all. For a node in JSON documents,
the value is the string form if the value from JSON point of view
is a primitive type (not an array or object), and the value
is an empty string if the value from JSON point of view
is an array, an object or nothing at all.
The same is true for local variables bound to nodes (will cover later when such
situation may occur).

<h4>Function calls</h4>
The following are examples of function calls:
<pre>
   length("GOOD-BYE")
   12 * (7 + 5)
   "Value is " | $ORDER.DueDate | "!"
   square(squar(2))
</pre>
<p>Magic Box allows to define functions easily, either in native implementation
language (Java and C) or in rule language itself. For expressions used
in MDW, the following table lists all predefined functions:</p>

<table border=1>
	<tr><th>Function</th><th>Semantics</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem"><var>expr<sub>1</sub></var>+<var>expr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
		<td>Addition of integers.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem"><var>expr<sub>1</sub></var>-<var>expr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
		<td>Subtraction of integers</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem"><var>expr<sub>1</sub></var>*<var>expr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
		<td>Multiplication of integers.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem"><var>expr<sub>1</sub></var>/<var>expr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
		<td>Integer division.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem"><var>expr<sub>1</sub></var>%<var>expr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
		<td>Modulo operation.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem"><var>expr<sub>1</sub></var>|<var>expr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
		<td>String concatenation.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem">substring(<var>expr</var>,<var>start</var>)</td>
		<td>Return a substring of the string value of the expression,
			 starting from location <var>start</var>, which must be an 
			 expression evaluated to numbers.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem">substring(<var>expr</var>,<var>start</var>,<var>end</var>)</td>
		<td>Return a substring of the string value of the expression,
		    starting from location <var>start</var> (an expression evaluated 
		    to a number)
		    and end before <var>end</var> (another expression evaluated to
		    numbers.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem">time(<var>format</var>)</td>
		<td>Return current time in the given format (which is
		    an expression), as defined for the Java
				class <code>SimpleDateFormat</code>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem">today()</td>
		<td>Is equivalent to <code>time("MM-dd-yyyy")</code>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="descitem">length(<var>expr</var>)</td>
		<td>Return the length of the string value of the given expression.</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td class="descitem">replaceall(<var>expr</var>,<var>pattern</var>,<var>by</var>)</td>
		<td>Return a string constructed from <var>expr</var> by
		    replacing all occurances of <var>pattern</var>, which
		    is a regular expression, by <var>by</var> 
		    </td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h4>Conditional expression</h4>
Conditional expression takes the following general form:
<dl>
   <dt>([<var>cond<sub>1</sub></var>]<var>expr<sub>1</sub></var>;
		[<var>cond<sub>2</sub></var>]<var>expr<sub>2</sub></var>;
		... ...;
		<var>expr<sub>n</sub></var>)</dt>
</dl>
<p>where <var>n</var> is 2 or more.
For those familiar with Java conditional expression syntax, the above
is similar to Java syntax <code>(<var>cond<sub>1</sub></var>?<var>expr<sub>1</sub></var>:
<var>cond<sub>2</sub></var>?<var>expr<sub>2</sub></var>: ... ... :<var>expr<sub>n</sub></var>)</code>,
where <var>cond<sub>n</sub></var> are conditions described in the next section.
The following are examples of conditional expression:</p>
<pre>
   ( [var&gt;12] 12; [var&lt;5] 5; var )
   ([exist $$.Services.DSL] "hasDSL" ; "noDSL"")
</pre>

<h2>Conditions</h2>

The following description defines what a condition can be:
<ul>
   <li>A basic conditions, such as <code>var &gt; 6</code></li>
   <li>An existential condition (detail covered below)</li>
   <li>Negation of a condition, as in <code>not 5&gt;6</code></li>
   <li>Join of two conditions, as in <code>x&gt;6 and x&lt;12</code></li>
   <li>Union of two conditions, as in <code>x&lt;6 or x&gt;12</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We describe the syntax for all above below, as well as special
explanations on existence and pattern matching predicates.</p>

<h4>Basic predicates</h4>
The following table lists basic prediates:
<table border=1>
  <tr><th width="200px">Predicate</th><th>Semantics</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="descitem"><var>expr<sub>1</sub></var> == <var>expr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
	<td>String comparsion for equality, such as <code>$$.DueDate=="2012-02-02"</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td class="descitem"><var>expr<sub>1</sub></var> != <var>expr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
  	<td>String comparsion for inequality, such as <code>line.TN!="303 555-6666"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td class="descitem"><var>numexpr<sub>1</sub></var> &lt; <var>numexpr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
  	<td>Arithmetic comparsion for less-than, such as <code>var&lt;6</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td class="descitem"><var>numexpr<sub>1</sub></var> &lt;= <var>numexpr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
  	<td>Arithmetic comparsion for less-than or equal-to, such as <code>var&lt;=6</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td class="descitem"><var>numexpr<sub>1</sub></var> &gt; <var>numexpr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
  	<td>Arithmetic comparsion for greater-than, such as <code>var&gt;6</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td class="descitem"><var>numexpr<sub>1</sub></var> &gt;= <var>numexpr<sub>2</sub></var></td>
  	<td>Arithmetic comparsion for greater-than or equal-to, such as <code>var&gt;=6</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td class="descitem"><var>dateexpr<sub>1</sub></var> &lt;&lt; <var>dateexpr<sub>2</sub></var></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td class="descitem"><var>dateexpr<sub>1</sub></var> &gt;&gt; <var>dateexpr<sub>2</sub></var></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="descitem">true</td>
    <td>always evaluates to true</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="descitem"><var>expr</var> like "<var>pattern</var>"</td>
    <td><var>pattern</var> is a regular expression.
	Note this matches the whole expression, not just a substring.
	If you would like to match a substring, need to use <code>.*</code>
	before and/or after the pattern. Atditionally,
        variables can be bound to substrings (explanation and examples
        are in early sections).
	</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td class="descitem"><var>expr</var> in <var>nodeval</var>
  	</td>
  	<td>When <var>nodeval</var> is bound to a table, the table must have exactly one column.
  	     The predicate evaluates to true if the value of the expression
  	     is in table.
  	    When <var>nodeval</var> is bound to a node and <var>expr</var>
  	    also evaluates to a node, then the predicate evaluates to true
  	    if the former node is an ancestor of the latter node.
  	    When <var>nodeval</var> is bound to a node and <var>expr</var>

</table>
<cite>Magic Box allows to define additional relations, called predicates, in Java or in Magic Box
rule language itself easily, the above set is what MDW has implemented for its
Magic engine.</cite>

<h4>Compound Conditions</h4>
Conditions can be combined using the logic operators "and", "or"
and "not" to form combound conditions.
<dl>
  <dt><var>cond<sub>1</sub></var> and <var>cond<sub>2</sub></var></dt>
  <dd>The composite condition is true if and only if
      both <var>cond<sub>1</sub></var> and <var>cond<sub>2</sub></var> are true.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><var>cond<sub>1</sub></var> or <var>cond<sub>2</sub></var></dt>
  <dd>The composite condition is true if and only if
      at least one of <var>cond<sub>1</sub></var> and <var>cond<sub>2</sub></var> 
      is true.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt>not <var>cond</var></dt>
  <dd>The composite condition is true when <var>cond</var>
      is false, and vice versa</dd>
</dl>

Note that <code>not</code> has higher precedence than <code>and</code>,
which in turn has higher precedence than <code>or</code>.
Use parenthesis when the precedence needs to be altered.  

<a name="exist"><!--  --></a>
<h4>Existence Predicate</h4>
Existence predicate is one of the most powerful features for conditions.
There two common forms as shown below:
<dl>
  <dt>
     exist <var>var</var> like <var>nodepattern</var></font>
     <font color=black>[</font>
	with (<var>cond</var>)
     <font color=black>]</font>
     <br/>
     exist <var>var</var>
     <font color=black>[</font>in<font color=black>|</font>before<font color=black>|</font>after<font color=black>]</font>
     <var>nodeval</var>
     <font color=black>[</font>
	with (<var>cond</var>)
     <font color=black>]</font>
     </dt>
  <dd/>
</dl>
<p>In the first form, the local variable <var>var</var> is bound to
     the first node whose names match the given pattern <var>nodepattern</var>,
     and the nested condition <var>cond</var>, if presents, is satisfied.
     The local variable can be referenced in the nested condition part.
     The condition is true when such a node is found, and false otherwise.</p>
<p>In the second form, the local variable <var>var</var> is bound to
      the first node that is the child of <var>nodeval</var> (for <code>in</code>),
      the first node of the same parent before <var>nodeval</var> (for <code>before</code>),
      or the first node of the same parent after <var>nodeval</var> (for <code>after</code>).
      If the optional nexted condition <var>cond</var> is present, the predicate
      will bind the variable to the first node that also satisfies the condition.
      The condition is true when such a node is found, and false otherwise.</p>
<p>
The following are some examples.
<pre>
    exist service like $$.Services."Line|DSL" with ( service:action == "add" )
    exist service in $$.Services with (exist tnOrDn like service."TN|DN" )
    exist line like $$.Services.Line with line.TN like "303 (...){nxx}-(....){xxxx}"
    exist line like $$.Services.Line with (exist tn like line.TN and tn like "303.*")
    exist node like $$.chapter.Services.Line[action="add"].TN
    exist node like $$..TN
</pre>
<p>
The existence predicate can also be used in the following form:
<dl>
  <dt>exist <var>nodepattern</var></dt>
  <dd/>
</dl>
which is a simple case when the optional condition is not needed
and the variable is not needed, either. Sematically, this
is equivalent to <code>exist node like <var>nodepattern</var></code>.
Here is an example (in the nested condition):
<pre>
    exist line like $$.Services.Line with (exist line.TN)
</pre>
Finally, the existence predicate can be used to check if
a global variable is bound. The syntax
is:
<dl>
  <dt>exist variable <var>varname</var></dt>
  <dd/>
</dl>
and an example is
<pre>
   exist variable REGION
</pre>
<h4>Temporary variable</h4>
<dl>
  	<dt>when <var>var</var> = <var>expr</var></dt>
  	<dd/>
</dl>
This is a pseudo condition that is always true.
It is used to hold a value in a variable so that we can use the value
in later conditions. Example:
<pre>
    when tmp = 12*(9-7) and tmp &gt; 30

<h2>Alternative XML Mapping</h2>

<p>For XML documents, by default, the name of the node
representing an XML element is its tag, and the value of 
the node is the direct text in the element.
The attributes of the element are accessed as attributes
of the node.</p>

<p>There are cases when the XML documents contain a lot of
generic tags but using some attribute to diffentiate
the different semantic types. This technique for XML
is often used for highly dynamic data such as service
orders, so that the XSD does not have to be changed
when new data types need to be added. This is
the case for the form data documents used in MDW,
where only a few actual XML tags are used
(e.g. FIELD, SUBFORM, and TABLE).
For such documents, while the default mapping
can still be used, the conditions and expressions
will become cumbersome and far less readable.</p>
<p>Magic Box offers an alternative mapping to gain
the readability for such documents. An attribute
such as NAME in the case of form data document
is designated as the name of the node (instead of
using tags), and the tags are accessible
using a special attribute syntax <code>#node</code>.
Take the following sample form data document as an example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;FORMDATA&gt;
  &lt;FIELD NAME='COUNTRY'&gt;USA&lt;/FIELD&gt;
  &lt;FIELD NAME='STATE'&gt;Colorado&lt;/FIELD&gt;
  &lt;FIELD NAME='DD'&gt;2009-03-09&lt;/FIELD&gt;
  &lt;SUBFORM NAME='TABLE_DATA_META'&gt;
     &lt;FIELD NAME='total_rows'&gt;10&lt;/FIELD&gt;
     &lt;FIELD NAME='start_row'&gt;1&lt;/FIELD&gt;
  &lt;/SUBFORM&gt;
  &lt;TABLE NAME='TABLE_DATA'&gt;
     &lt;ROW&gt;
        &lt;FIELD NAME='RED'&gt;red&lt;/FIELD&gt;
        &lt;FIELD NAME='GREEN'&gt;green&lt;/FIELD&gt;
        &lt;FIELD NAME='BLUE'&gt;blue&lt;/FIELD&gt;
     &lt;/ROW&gt;
     &lt;ROW&gt;
        &lt;FIELD NAME='RED'&gt;rot&lt;/FIELD&gt;
        &lt;FIELD NAME='GREEN'&gt;gruen&lt;/FIELD&gt;
        &lt;FIELD NAME='BLUE'&gt;blau&lt;/FIELD&gt;
     &lt;/ROW&gt;
     &lt;ROW&gt;
        &lt;FIELD NAME='RED'&gt;hong&lt;/FIELD&gt;
        &lt;FIELD NAME='GREEN'&gt;lue&lt;/FIELD&gt;
        &lt;FIELD NAME='BLUE'&gt;lan&lt;/FIELD&gt;
     &lt;/ROW&gt;
  &lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;/FORMDATA&gt;
</pre>
<p>The following gives some sample expressions and their corresponding values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>$$.COUNTRY</code> has the value <code>"USA"</code></li>
  <li><code>$$.TABLE_DATA_META.total_rows</code> has the value <code>10</code></li>
  <li><code>exist row in $$.TABLE_DATA with row.RED=="rot"</code> 
      will bind the variable <var>row</var> to the second row in the table</li>
  <li><code>#$$.TABLE_DATA</code> has the value <code>"TABLE"</code></li>
</ul>
