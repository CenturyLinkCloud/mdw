<h1>Using Activity Implementor InvokeMultipleProcessActivity</h1>

This implementor allows you to start multiple instances of 
a given subprocess. It uses a table (of type MbengTableArray)
or a java.util.List (whose elements are of type DynaRow)
as the means of controlling how many instances to create
and how the parameters are bound for each instance.
<p>
Please refer to <a href="InvokeSubProcessActivity.html">this link</a>
for invoking a single instance of the sub process. The linked
document also explains parameter modes and bindings, if you're not
already familiar with these concepts.
<p>
The column names of the table or list are used to match parameters
of the subprocesses. The activity creates one instance of the subprocess
for each row. The parameters to be bound for the instance
of the subprocess are specified in the corresponding row
of the table or list. It should contain columns corresponding
to all input or input/output parameters of the subprocess.
<p>
Besides the table or list, you also need to specify
which column contains the key and which column
is used for return code. The key column values
must be unique, as these are used to distinguish
between subprocesses. The return code column is currently
used only by the implementor to record whether the subprocesses
have terminated, so even though you need to define such
a column, your code should not try to assign values to the
fields of the column.
<p>
<h3>MbengTableArray Example</h3>
The control table can be created as in the following example
(argument column is the key, retcode column is for
return code, and result column is for output):
<pre>
	String[] header = {"argument", "retcode", "result"};
	MbengTableArray table = new MbengTableArray(header);
	String[] row1 = {"1", "", ""};
	String[] row2 = {"2", "", ""};
	String[] row3 = {"3", "", ""};
	table.addRow(row1);
	table.addRow(row2);
	table.addRow(row3);
</pre>

<h3>DynaRows Examples</h3>
DynaRows are especially helpful when you're decomposing an XML
document on the main process into parseable fragments for the subprocess(es).
DynaRows build on the Groovy Expando concept, and they can be initialized
either using either XMLBeans or GPath syntax:
<pre>
	// XMLBeans example
	travelers = vacRequest.getVacationPlan().getTravelers().getTravelerList();
	dynaRows = [];
	for (i in 0..travelers.size()-1)
	{
	  row = new DynaRow();
	  row.keyval = i.toString();
	  row.retcode = '';
	  row.traveler = travelers.get(i);
	  row.cuid = travelers.get(i).getCuid();
	  dynaRows.add(row);
	}
	
	// GPath example
	vacPlan = new XmlParser().parseText(xml);
	travelers = vacPlan.Travelers.Traveler;	
	dynaRows = [];
	for (i in 0..travelers.size()-1)
	{
	  row = new DynaRow();
	  row.keyval = i.toString();
	  row.retcode = '';
	  row.traveler = travelers[i];
	  row.cuid = travelers[i].@cuid;
	  dynaRows.add(row);
	}	  
</pre>

<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The variable corresponding to the key in the subprocess must have 
      Input/Output mode, not just Input, even though the subprocess should
      never change its value. The reason is that the parent
      process needs to read its value when a subprocess terminates, in order
      to determine which subprocess has terminated. </li>
  <li>The return code column should not have a corresponding variable defined
      in the subprocess, and should not need an initialization value. It is used
      by the framework internally to manage the status of subprocesses.</li>
  <li>When using DynaRows, Eclipse Designer is able to view the DynaRow content
      in human-readable format only when the Groovy plug-in is also installed.</li>
</ul>
After the processes are completed,
the return code column should contain the value "FINISH",
and all columns corresponding to output or input/output 
parameters of the subprocess should be populated.
<br/><br/>
For MbengTables, you can use the following code to retrieve output values:
<pre>
	String key = "2";
	Object row = table.getRow(key);
	String result = table.getValue(row, 2);
	// 2 is the index of column "result" 
</pre>
<br/>
For DynaRows, the code looks like this:
<pre>
	myCuid = dynaRows[i].cuid;
	myXmlBean = dynaRows[i].traveler;
	// or
	myGroovyNode = dynaRows[i].traveler;
</pre>

<h2>Wait For Unsolicited Events</h2>
It is often desired that when a process is waiting
for all sub processes, it needs to handle
unsolicited external events such as receiving a supplemental
order or cancellation of the request.
The activity allows to optionally register for listening
to unsolicited events before all subprocesses terminate.
It uses the same mechanism as <code>EventWaitActivity</code> to register
the event waits (following <a href="EventWaitActivity.html">this link</a>
for details of event wait registration and additional details).
<p>
When the activity instance receives an event before the timer expires,
it can be left in one of the 2 statuses:

<ul>
  <li>Hold. The activity instance will be put on a hold status (showing cyan color
  		in the designer's process instance view). While the activity instance in hold status,
  		subprocess termination will be recorded but the activity will remain in hold
  		status, without being completed. When the
  		activity is put back on waiting status (see <a href="EventWaitActivity.html">this link</a>
  		for discussion on how this can happen), if all subprocesses are already terminated, or
  		another event it is waiting for has been received,
  		the activity instance will process that.</li>
  <li>Waiting. The activity instance continues waiting (i.e. still actively responds
      to sub process termination as well as other unsolicited events).</li>
</ul>

We note that the activity can only listen to recurring events. This limitation
is needed to avoid infinite looping when the activity instances resume
waiting from hold status, non-recurring events that have already arrived
would always trigger a transition.
<p>
To provide custom code handling unsolicited events, you will need to override 
<code>processOtherMessage(String message)</code>. 
The method is passed in with one argument, which is the entire message. The default
method does nothing. The completion code after processing the message is configured
in the designer, but you can override it in the code by invoking <code>setReturnCode()</code>.
