<h1>Using Activity Implementor EventWaitActivity</h1>

This implementor is used to wait for external messages, solicited
(asynchronous response messages) or unsolicited (such as
order cancellation messages).

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<h3>Events</h3>
The attribute "Events" specifies one or more events the activity instance is waiting for.
Each event specification contains three entries:
<ul>
  <li>Event Name. This is an event name that is used to match with event names generated
      by external event handlers. The event name can contain place holders
      for including dynamic contents such as process instance IDs.</li>
  <li>Completion code. This is used to set the completion code after the activity
      instance is waken by an external message. To set a transition event type
      other than FINISH, prepend the event type name and colon, such as "<code>ERROR</code>"
      or "<code>ABORT:ByUser</code>".</li>
  <li>Recurring. This is a check box. If checked, it indicates the event can occur
      multiple times for the given process instance. A typical example is pending order change.</li> 
</ul>
The syntax for place holder is a "$" and a variable name enclosed in braces ("{" and "}"),
such as <code>{$my_variable_1}</code>. Besides process variables, the following variable names
have predefined meanings:
<table>
  <tr><td>{$ProcessInstanceID}</td><td>Has the value of the process instance ID</td></tr>
  <tr><td>{$MasterRequestID}</td><td>Has the value of the master request ID</td></tr>
  <tr><td>{$ActivityInstanceID}</td><td>Has the value of the activity instance ID</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Timeout and Status after Timeout</h3>
The time out attribute specifies how long we should time out the waiting.
When the value is 0 or negative, the activity waits indefinitely.
<p>
The activity should have a DELAY outgoing transition to indicate what should
be done when a timeout happens. If a DELAY transition is not defined,
the DELAY embedded process will be looked at next. If that does not exist
either, the DELAY embedded process of the parent process instance will be
invoked, and so on. If no process instances in the chain has embedded
DELAY process, no transition is made (and no exception will be reported).
<p>
The attribute "Status after Timeout" specifies what status the activity
should be set when a timeout situation occurs. There are 3 statuses possible:
<ul>
  <li>Canceled. The activity instance will be canceled.</li>
  <li>Hold. The activity instance will be put on a hold status (showing cyan color
  		in the designer's process instance view). The activity instance in hold status
  		will not react to external messages received until it is resumed waiting
  		(discussed below).</li>
  <li>Waiting. The activity instance continues waiting (i.e. still actively listening for
      events).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes About Timeouts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The mdw.timer.ThresholdForDelay setting (in minutes, with a default of 60) controls whether JMS or DB is used for storing timeouts (values below the threshold use JMS; those above use DB).</li>
  <li>In ServiceMix, JMS timeouts require "scheduleSupport" in localhost-broker.xml and may not be preserved across a server shutdown.</li>
  <li>The MDW scheduled event monitor runs at a frequency specified by mdw.timer.CheckInterval (in seconds with a default of 60), and with an initial startup delay of mdw.timer.InitialDelay (in seconds with a default value of 300).  So this means that db timeouts cannot be expected to be more accurate +/- 1 minute.  It also means that when the server is initially started the check will not be performed for at least 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>It is highly recommended that the value of ThresholdForDelay NOT be set below 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>During testing, you may desire shorter timeouts than those expected in real-world scenarios.  In that case, it's important that you understand that the delays may not be accurate down to the minute if they're stored in the db.</li>
  <li>Also, you should understand that if the delay is stored in JMS then it can be lost after a server shutdown.  Furthermore, if your scenario calls for the timeout to be rescheduled, this can only be accommodated in the database as JMS timeouts cannot be changed once established.</li>
</ul>

If a DELAY transition is defined, to resume the activity instance into waiting status,
there must be another transition leading into the activity. If a DELAY transition is not
defined but there is a DELAY embedded subprocess (in the current or ancestor process instances),
the activity instance is resumed to waiting status when the embedded subprocess terminates.
When the activity instance is resumed to waiting status, it immediately processes
any events received while in holding status, so the activity instance may actually be
set to COMPLETED status immediately, depending on the result of event processing.

<h2>Processing Events</h2>
With this out-of-box implementor, you can only configure it to transition to specified
next activities. More often than not, you may need to process the messages received
with the event and perform some business logic.
This can be achieved by subclassing this implementor and override the method
<code>Integer processMessage(String message)</code>. The only argument to the method
is the XML message (in string form) received along with the event (probably from external
systems and stored in DOCUMENT table).
The method returns an activity status, dictating the status of the activity instance
to be set after processing the message. The valid statuses include:
<ul>
	<li><code>WorkStatus.STATUS_COMPLETED</code>: the activity instance is set to completed
		and transitions are made to next activities according to completion code
		specified in the configuration, which can be overriden using <code>setReturnCode()</code>.
		This is probably the return value of the choice in most cases.</li>
	<li><code>WorkStatus.STATUS_WAITING</code>: the activity instance is kept as in waiting status. 
	    No transition is made unless the completion code indicates a CORRECT or ABORT event type, in which
	    case it makes that transition while still waiting for events (in parallel).</li>
	<li><code>WorkStatus.STATUS_HOLD</code>: the activity instance is set to hold status. 
		No transition is made unless the completion code indicates a CORRECT or ABORT event type, in which
	    case it makes that transition. Typically you will need to specify a transition out to CORRECT, as there will be
	    no way to resume the activity instance without that.</li>
	<li><code>WorkStatus.STATUS_CANCELLED</code>: the activity instance is set to cancel status. 
		No transition is made unless the completion code indicates a CORRECT or ABORT event type, in which
	    case it makes that transition.</li>
</ul>
The default method <code>processMessage(String)</code> does nothing if Received Message Variable is not defined and returns <code>WorkStatus.STATUS_COMPLETED</code>.
<p>
If you do not have a need to override the method but would like to leave the activity in a status 
other than Completed, you can configure the completion code in designer by prepending "<code>Waiting::</code>", "<code>Hold::</code>", 
or "<code>Cancelled::</code>" to regular completion code. Examples include "<code>Hold::CORRECT</code>" and "<code>Waiting::</code>".

<br><br>Following table  compares 2 different types  of activities  and how to set the completion code with activity status = Hold. You can replace Hold with Waiting and Cancelled if that is what you want.<br><table
			width="100%" >
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Activity Name</th>
					<th style="width: 264px;">Event Wait</th>
					<th>Timer Wait/Manual Task/Sync/Heterogeneous</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tr>
				<td>Invoke Correction Handler with activity in Hold</td>
				<td>Completion code = Hold::CORRECT</td>
				<td>Completion code =CORRECT and select Hold from drop down on
					&quot;status after receiving  event&quot;</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Invoke CancellationHandler with activity in Hold</td>
				<td>Completion code = Hold:ABORT</td>
				<td>Completion code =ABORT and select Hold from drop down on
					&quot;status after receiving  event&quot;</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<h2>Return from Embedded Process</h2>
If a transition is made to a CORRECT, ABORT, ERROR or DELAY embedded process (the ERROR embedded process
is possible when the activity instance throws an exception), when the embedded process terminates:
<ul>
  <li>For ABORT embedded processes, it never comes back to the parent process, so there is never an impact.</li>
  <li>If the activity instance is in Hold status, it will be put back in Waiting status (just like DELAY discussed above).
      If there are any events received while in hold status, the method <code>processMessage()</code> will be invoked again, 
      which may immediately put the activity instance in a different status described above.</li>
  <li>If the activity instance is in any other status (possibly Waiting, Cancelled, Completed and Error),
      nothing will be done (especially, there will be
      no transition made to the next activities). </li>
</ul>
You can override the behavior (except for ABORT embedded processes, whose behavior cannot be overriden) 
by setting the completion code of the embedded process
(by calling <code>setProcessInstanceCompletionCode()</code>, or by selecting certain task actions described below
in a manual task in the ERROR embedded process). The following table summarizes the impacts:

<table border='1'>
  <tr><th>Subprocess completion code</th>
  		<th>Activity instance status is Hold</th>
  		<th>Activity instance status is Waiting,Cancelled or Failed</th>
  		<th>Activity instance status is Completed</th></tr>
  <tr><td>null (this is default) or <code>RESUME</code></td>
  		<td>put the activity in waiting status again and process pending events if there are any, as described above.</td>
  		<td>do nothing for Waiting and Cancelled statuses. For Failed status, complete the activity instance
  			and transition with null completion code.</td>
  		<td>do nothing</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>START</code> (corresponding to task action Retry)</td>
  		<td>(undefined)</td>
  		<td>cancel current activity instance
  			and restart another instance of the activity</td>
  		<td>restart another instance of the activity</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>ABORT</code> (corresponding to task action Cancel)</td>
  		<td>(undefined)</td>
  		<td>Cancel the activity</td>
  		<td>Do nothing</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>ABORT:this_process</code> (corresponding to task action Abort)</td>
  		<td>(undefined)</td>
  		<td>cancel the activity and terminate (complete) the parent process</td>
  		<td>terminate (complete) the parent process</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>FINISH</code> (corresponding to task action Complete)</td>
  		<td>(undefined)</td>
  		<td>complete the activity instance, and
  			transition accordingly (using transitions with no completion code)</td>
  		<td>transition accordingly (using transitions with no completion code)</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>FINISH:<i>compcode</i></code> (corresponding to custom task action <i>compcode</i>)</td>
  		<td>(undefined)</td>
  		<td>complete the activity instance, and
  			transition accordingly (first looking at transitions with <code>RESUME:<i>compcode</i></code> then <code><i>compcode</i></code> )</td>
  		<td>transition accordingly (first looking at transitions with <code>RESUME:<i>compcode</i></code> then <code><i>compcode</i></code> )</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Impact of Recurring Flag</h2>
When the recurring flag is not checked (default),
we have made the assumption that the event with the same name
will never occur again. In this case, MDW allows multiple
recipients for the event. In another word, if there are multiple
event wait activities registered for waiting the same event,
then all activities will be informed.
<p>
When the recurring flag is checked, it is an indication
that potentially multiple events with the same name can be 
received. To prevent processing of an old event, MDW restricts
that only one activity instance can wait for an event.
This is achieved as follows: when an event wait activity registers
to wait for a multiple occurrence event, the system automatically
de-register other activities registered for waiting the same event
(if there is any). Once the event is processed, it is marked
as finished, so future registration for the same event will
wait for another message.
<p>
<font color='red'>Important note: you should never put the activity
in Hold or Waiting status for a non-recurring event</font>. This is because, for Hold status, when the CORRECT embedded
process returns, it sees the non-recurring event again and invoke the CORRECT embedded
process again, causing infinite loop; and for Waiting status, it sees the same event again
immediately.

<h2>Event Wait in Other Activities</h2>
Besides <code>EventWaitActivity</code> (event wait), several other activities allow
to wait for unsolicited events:
<ul>
    <li><a href="TimerWaitActivity.html">Timer Wait</a></li>   
    <li><a href="taskWaitingEvents.html">Custom Manual Task</a></li>  
    <li><a href="InvokeMultipleSubprocesses.html">Invoke Multiple Subprocesses</a></li>  
    <li><a href="synchronization.html">Synchronization Activity</a></li>  
</ul>
The same event configuration mechanism is used to register event waits.
Additionally, you must specify the status of the activity instance to be left when
unsolicited event arrives. The default status is Hold. The following table lists allowed
statuses:
<table border='1'>
  <tr><th>Activity</th><th>Hold</th><th>Waiting</th><th>Cancelled</th></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="TimerWaitActivity.html">Timer Wait</a></td>
  		<td>hold on timer expiration until the activity instance is resumed waiting</td>
  		<td>continue responding to timer expiration in parallel</td>
  		<td>cancel the activity</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="taskWaitingEvents.html">Custom Manual Task</a></td>
  		<td>hold on task completion until the activity instance is resumed waiting</td>
  		<td>continue responding to task completion event in parallel</td>
  		<td>cancel the activity, <i>as well as</i> the task</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="InvokeMultipleSubprocesses.html">Invoke Multiple Subprocesses</a></td>
  		<td>hold on checking for all subprocess termination until the activity instance is resumed waiting</td>
  		<td>continue responding to subprocess termination in parallel</td>
  		<td>not allowed (designer does not give the option)</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="synchronization.html">Synchronization Activity</a></td>
  		<td>hold on checking for synchronization until the activity instance is resumed waiting</td>
  		<td>continue checking synchronization as incoming transitions arrive, in parallel</td>
  		<td>not allowed (designer does not give the option)</td></tr>
</table>
To customize event processing, you will need to override <code>processOtherMessage(String message)</code>
(not <code>processMessage()</code> which is for event wait). The method does not return anything, the default method does nothing.
<p>
When an embedded process returns, the same behavior as event wait activity described above applies, except
when resuming waiting from hold status, each activity behaves in its native way:
<ul>
   <li>For timer wait, it checks if the timer is already expired while in holding status. If yes, completes the activity,
   		otherwise check if another unsolicited event arrived. If yes, invoke processOtherMessage() again.</li>
   <li>For manual task, it checks if the task has been completed. If yes, process the task action accordingly;
   		otherwise check if another unsolicited event arrived. If yes, invoke processOtherMessage() again.</li>
   <li>For invoke multiple processes, it checks if all subprocesses are terminated. If yes, completes the activity,
   		otherwise check if another unsolicited event arrived. If yes, invoke processOtherMessage() again.</li>
   <li>For synchronization activity, it checks if the synchronization condition is satisfied. If yes, completes the activity,
   		otherwise check if another unsolicited event arrived. If yes, invoke processOtherMessage() again.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Event Wait: How to store received message in a process variable</h2>
If you want to store the message received by an Event wait you need to do following
<br/>
Define a process variable of Document type.
<br/>
Some of the common one used are as follows
<ul>
   	<li>org.w3c.dom.Document</li>
	<li>org.apache.xmlbeans.XmlObject</li>
	<li>com.centurylink.mdw.model.StringDocument</li>
</ul>

Once you have defined then you have to go to Design tab on the Event Wait activity. There the this variable would be available
in drop down of attribute named "Received Message Variable", if variable is defined of Document type.
This variable would store the received message when Event wait receives the event.
