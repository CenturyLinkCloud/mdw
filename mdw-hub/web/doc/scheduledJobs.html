<h1>Scheduled Jobs</h1>

<p>A common requirement of workflow applications is to periodically execute certain logic according to a set schedule.
MDW provides the <a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/model/data/monitor/ScheduledJob.html">ScheduledJob</a> interface,
which you can implement for this purpose.  The run() method in your ScheduledJob implementation is invoked according to a
scheduled spelled out in your MDW properties file.  The syntax for scheduling is similar to that of the familiar <command>cron</command>
utility.  Here's an example:</p>
<pre>
mdw.timer.task.ProcessCleanup.TimerClass=com.centurylink.mdw.timer.cleanup.ProcessCleanup
# run every day at 2:30 a.m.
mdw.timer.task.ProcessCleanup.Schedule=30 2 * * ? *
</pre>
<p>This example shows the scheduling of the MDW-provided 
<a href="http://cshare.ad.qintra.com/sites/MDW/Wiki%20Pages/ProcessCleanupScheduledJob.aspx">Process Cleanup</a> job to remove old runtime instances.
The value for the first property is the fully-qualified scheduled job class name, and the second property defines the schedule.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Note:</span> For custom ScheduledJobs in an OSGi environment, you'll need to register 
your ScheduledJob implementor in your bundle-context Spring config as follows:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;bean id="myScheduledJob" class="com.centurylink.mdw.myworkflow.MyScheduledJob" />
  &lt;osgi:service ref="myScheduledJob">
    &lt;osgi:interfaces>
      &lt;value>com.centurylink.mdw.model.data.monitor.ScheduledJob&lt;/value>
    &lt;/osgi:interfaces>
  &lt;/osgi:service>
</pre>
<p>This is because the MDW bundle does not have access to your bundle's ClassLoader and will rely on the OSGi service registry to provide an instance.</p>
<p>In MDW 5.5 you can implement your ScheduledJob as <a href="dynamicJava.html">Dynamic Java</a>, and flag it as a registered service through Annotations:</p>
<pre>
  @RegisteredService(ScheduledJob.class)
  public class MyScheduledJob implements ScheduledJob, Serializable {
      public void run(CallURL args) {
          // do something on schedule 
      }
  }
</pre>
<h3>Job Execution</h3>
<p>MDW guarantees that your scheduled job will run exactly once per scheduled interval at the designated time.  We take appropriate locking
precautions to prevent multiple server instances in your clustered environment from racing each other to execute the job.  By default, it's 
undefined which server instance will pick up the job (in practice it's common that the same instance ends up always running the job).  In 
MDW 5.5 you have the option of balancing job execution across multiple nodes in a cluster.  Out-of-the-box we provide the 
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/workflow/monitor/strategy/RoundRobinScheduledJob.html">RoundRobinScheduledJob</a> strategy.
If your ScheduledJob implementation extends this base class, then you'll get simple round-robin balancing for free.  If you need a more
customized approach, then you can extend <a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/model/data/monitor/LoadBalancedScheduledJob.html">LoadBalancedScheduledJob</a>
to implement your own distribution logic.</p> 
<h3>Job Arguments</h3>
<p>Use of job arguments is illustrated by another MDW built-in ScheduledJob implementation, 
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/timer/process/ScheduledProcessStart.html">ScheduledProcessStart</a>.
Example usage:</p>
<pre>
# launch MyWorkflowProcess every day at 10:45
mdw.timer.task.MyProcessJob.TimerClass=com.centurylink.mdw.timer.process.ScheduledProcessStart?ProcessName=com.centurylink.mypackage.MyWorkflowProcess
mdw.timer.task.MyProcessJob.Schedule=45 10 * * ? *
</pre>
<p>The argument name/value here is ProcessName=com.centurylink.mypackage.MyWorkflowProcess.  Arguments are appended to the scheduled job
registration property in a form like URL request parameters.  These arguments are made available to your run() method via its
<a href="../javadoc/com/centurylink/mdw/common/utilities/form/CallURL.html">CallURL</a> parameter.  The CallURL class provides
methods such as getParameter() for retrieving the designated values.</p>
