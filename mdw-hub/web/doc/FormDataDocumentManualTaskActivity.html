<h1>Using Activity Implementor FormDataDocumentManualTaskActivity</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The General Manual Task Activity has been implemented in 
later versions of MDW 4, to provide a simpler 
conceptual and usage model than the <a href='taskAction.html'>classic manual tasks</a>
and yet greater flexibility and extensibility.
It is our intention to gradually move away from classic manual tasks
and support general manual tasks only.

<h3>Differences from Classic Manual Task Activities</h3>
The primary difference between classic manual tasks and general manual tasks
is their data model. Classic manual tasks are closely coupled with
the process instances that created them, and the data on the manual tasks
are the variable instances of the corresponding process instances.
General manual tasks, on the other hand, take a loosely-coupled philosophy.
The task manager and the process engine do not directly share data but rather
communicate with each other through a standard data document, called <em>
form data document</em>. The following is a list of main differences
as the result of this redesign.
<ul>
  <li>The data associated with a classic manual task is typically
      process variables stored in the engine, accessing and updating
      data in the tasks result communication with the engine (hence closely coupled).
      A general manual tasks receives a copy of the form data document from the engine
      and operates on the local copy.</li>
  <li>For classic manual tasks, as part of the task activity configuration,
    a subset of the process variables are designated to be sent
    to the task manager. For general manual tasks,
    the data exchanged is a single XML document (represented
    by the Java class <code>FormDataDocument</code>). This arrangement
    at least simplifies the following two aspects:
    <ul>
      <li>You do not need to create a lot of process variables
          for the sake of displaying their data in the task manager.</li>
      <li>As a result, the coding around the data can be
          much simpler, as the data document can be passed
          around as a single variable.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Classic manual tasks present the data in a pre-defined
    formats (a list of variable entries), and it used to allow only
    limited customization.  In MDW 5 you can also obtain greater customization
    through the use of <a href='customWeb.html'>custom pages</a>.
    General manual tasks, on the other hand, require the use of custom pages
    for display by default and provide an auto-form mechanism if all you need
    is to display some process variables. The custom pages can be in HTML (extended
    with place holders), Pagelet forms (MDW proprietary and comes with a WYSIWYG
    GUI builder), and JSF/Facelet in the near future.

  </li>
  <li>The general manual tasks support multiple-page (multiple steps)
    tasks through process definition naturally. Multiple
    pages cannot be achieved using classic manual tasks without
    significant coding in custom task managers.</li>
  <li>General manual tasks allow a clear separation between the MDW engine which
    generates the tasks during process execution and the task manager,
    especially it does not assume the task manager runs in the
    same work flow applications, enabling us to implement a centralized task manager
    for all MDW based work flow applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Furthermore, general manual tasks 
    can even interface with <em>non-MDW-provided task managers</em>, as the interface between
    the task manager and the engine is clearly defined in a simple manner
    (the transport is JMS messages, the pay load is the form data document introduced below).
  </li>
  <li>General manual tasks also allow call-backs from the tasks to the process engine
      (for tasks such as retrieving data from external systems and performing complex business functions).</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Concepts</h3>

A <em>Task Definition</em>, is a manual task activity 
(in this case the general manual
task activity) along with configurations. A <em>Task Instance</em>
is an instance of a task definition and could be viewed
as an instance of the activity, although for both conceptual
and implementation reasons, we consider the activity instances
and task instances as separate entities. A task instance
represent an work item for a user in the task manager, which
typically has a corresponding activity instance, but in case
of multiple-step tasks, the same task instance may involve
multiple activity instances (one for each step).
The term <em>Task</em> is often used to refer to either task definitions
or task instances, so we try to avoid using the term 
here to avoid confusion.
<p>
We follow the well-known model-view-control philosophy for GUI application design.
The model, namely the data, is represented by XML documents
that are accessed in Java as the instances of the class
<em>FormDataDocument</em>. The view part is represented
by one of the several technologies MDW supports, including
HTML, JSF/Facelet, and <em>pagelet forms</em>, which are
XML documents generated by the GUI builder
and typically you do not need to manipulate the XML directly.
The control portion is done through <em>form actions</em>, which
are Java classes implementing the interface <code>FormAction</code>
and typically modify form data document and determine which pages
to show next, among others.
<p/>
A task is associated with one or more <em>user groups</em> and any user
in those groups can see the instances of the task.

<h2>Configuration - Attributes</h2>

<h3>Basic Attributes</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Task Name" is the label of the task instances to be
displayed in the task lists in the task manager.</li>
<li>"Form Name" specifies which form the task activity
is associated with. The drop down list contains all forms
defined in the database. With MDW 5, versioning of forms
is supported and hence you will also need to select the version
of the form</li>
<li>"Task Description" is optional and is meant to provides
a bit more detailed description of the tasks than the task names.</li>
<li>"Form Data Document Variable" specifies the name
of a document variable that is associated with the data document
(FormDataDocument). You may choose not to use a process variable
for the data document
if you override the method <code>createFormData()</code>.</li>
<li>"Wait for Task" specifies whether the activity
instance should wait for the user to complete the task instance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Due Date/Time, Observer, and Notifications</h3>

Click <a href="taskSLA.html">this link</a> to find out details
about task due date or due time, a.k.a SLA, and alerts when
the due date/time is passed.
<p/>
Click <a href="taskObservers.html">this link</a> to find out details
about task observers.
<p>
Click <a href="taskNotices.html">this link</a> to find out details
about task notifications.
<p/>
The URL to access task instances directly for HTML or Pagelet form implemented tasks is
<code>http://<var>host</var>:<var>port</var>/<var>MDWTaskManagerWeb</var>/MDWHTTPListener/task?name=<var>taskInstanceId</var></code>.
For JSF implemented task instances, the URL is
<code>http://<var>host</var>:<var>port</var>/<var>MDWTaskManagerWeb</var>/facelets/tasks/taskAction.jsf?taskInstanceId=<var>taskInstanceId</var></code>.

<h3>Work Group and Auto-Assignment</h3>
<em>TBD</em>

<h3>Listening to Unsolicited Events</h3>
The attribute "Events" and "Status after receiving event"
are used for listening to unsolicited events such
as order cancellation and supplement.
<p>
Refer to the last section of the document
for <a href="EventWaitActivity.html">EventWaitActivity</a>
for the descriptions.

<h2>Model - Form Data Document</h2>

We use an XML document to represent data to be presented on a form.
The following is a simple example:
<pre>
&lt;FORMDATA>
  &lt;SUBFORM NAME='META'>
     &lt;FIELD NAME='ACTION'>@CREATE_TASK&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;/SUBFORM>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='DueDate'>2009-03-09&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;FIELD NAME='OrderType'>Change&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;SUBFORM NAME='Address'>
     &lt;FIELD NAME='COUNTRY'>USA&lt;/FIELD>
     &lt;FIELD NAME='STATE'>Colorado&lt;/FIELD>
     &lt;FIELD NAME='CITY'>Denver&lt;/FIELD>
     &lt;FIELD NAME='STREET'>930 15th&lt;/FIELD>
  &lt;/SUBFORM>
  &lt;TABLE NAME='Contacts'>
     &lt;ROW NAME='ROW'>
        &lt;FIELD NAME='FirstName'>Jiyang&lt;/FIELD>
        &lt;FIELD NAME='LastName'>Xu&lt;/FIELD>
     &lt;/ROW>
     &lt;ROW NAME='ROW'>
        &lt;FIELD NAME='FirstName'>Don&lt;/FIELD>
        &lt;FIELD NAME='LastName'>Oakes&lt;/FIELD>
     &lt;/ROW>
  &lt;/TABLE>
&lt;/FORMDATA>
</pre>

In its simplest form, the form data document is a collection of name-value pairs to be displayed
on a form. The XML document is defined by the XSD following <a href="FormData_v01.xsd">this link</a>.
Here are a few highlights of the form data document contents:
<ul>
  <li>The basic entries of the document are name value pairs with the XML tag <code>FIELD</code>.</li>
  <li>It can contain a section of name-value pairs using the XML tag <code>SUBFORM</code>, which
      can in turn contains other <code>SUBFORM</code>s, thereby forming a tree of name-value pairs.</li>
  <li>It can also contain XML tag <code>TABLE</code>, which contains a collection of rows (with tag <code>ROW</code>)
      or entries (with tag <code>ENTRY</code>) which are essentially single column rows.</li>
  <li>A special section (sub-form) named <code>META</code> is used to hold meta information about the task and actions to be performed.
      A lot of the fields in this section are populated automatically by the engines and/or task manager.</li>
  <li>The XML is structured in such a way that it is straightforward to translate from and to JSON representation
  	  (tables correspond to JSON arrays, and sub-forms correspond to JSON objects).</li>
</ul>
By default, the activity assumes that form data document has been already generated
by previous activities and it is stored in the variable whose name is specified
in the attribute "Form Data Document Variable". The activity will 
send a task creation message to the task manager, using the form data document
after adding necessary meta fields.
<p>
You can also subclass the activity and override the method <code>createFormData()</code>
to customize the generation of the form data document.
As an example, the following code mimics classic manual task and generates
a form data document containing all process instance variables:
</p>
<pre>
@Override
protected FormDataDocument createFormData() throws ActivityException {
    FormDataDocument datadoc = new FormDataDocument();
    for (VariableInstanceInfo var : this.getParameters()) {
        String value;
        if (var.isDocument()) {
            value = VariableTranslator.realToString(var.getType(), var.getData());
        } else value = var.getStringValue();
        try {
            datadoc.setValue(var.getName(), value);
        } catch (MbengException e) {
            this.logwarn("Failed to set variable in form data document: " + var.getName());
        }
    }
    return datadoc;
}
</pre>
When the task is completed and when a form data document variable
is specified, the activity by default will 
replace the content of the form data document by the one received
from the task manager.
If you would like to perform any other variable binding, you can override
the method <code>extractFormData(FormDataDocument)</code>
Note you will need to call <code>super.extractFormData(datadoc)</code>
unless you do not have form data document variable specified
or do not want to update its content.

<h2>View - Custom Pages</h2>
MDW provides the following mechanism for defining custom pages:
    <ul>
      <li>HTML with jQuery and MDW extensions. We will
         cover briefly below and a more thorough coverage along with working sample code
         can be found at the link <code>http://<var>host</var>:<var>port</var>/<var>MDWTaskManagerWeb</var>/MDWHTTPListener/form?name=html:htmlDocAndSample</code>
         when you have an MDW-based application server is running.
         <a href='https://ecomt-v1.dev.qintra.com/ESOTaskManagerWeb/MDWHTTPListener/form?name=html:htmlDocAndSample' target='_blank'>This link</a>
         points to ESOWF System Test 1.</li>
      <li><a href='customWeb.html'>JSF/Facelet custom pages</a>.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The following is a sample in-flow task HTML page.
The portion in blue color is the task specific data for which you always need to customize.</p>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN'
	'http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd'&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Task &#35;{META.TaskName}&lt;/title&gt;
&#35;{MDW.STANDARD_INCLUDES}          <em>&lt;!-- javascript/css inclusion  --&gt;</em>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
&#35;{MDW.FORMDATA}                   <em>&lt;!-- javascript/css inclusion  --&gt;</em>
$(document).ready(function (){    <em>&lt;!-- standard initialization  --&gt;</em>
   setReadonlyWhenNotAssigned();
   outputData('.dataOut');
   if (formdata.ERROR!=undefined) {
       jAlert(formdata.ERROR.join('&lt;br/&gt;'),'Error');
   }
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor='#e0f0f0'&gt;
&lt;form id='mdw_form' method='post' action='form'&gt;
&lt;input id='mdw_formdata' name='mdw_formdata' type='hidden'/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Task &lt;span class='dataOut' data='META.TaskName'&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class='dataOut' data='META.TaskInstanceId'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&#35;{MDW.TASK_COMMON_DATA}           <em>&lt;!-- common task meta data --&gt;</em>
<font color='#0000c0'>
&lt;fieldset <font color='black'>id='ajax_update'</font>&gt;       <em>&lt;!-- task specific data --&gt;</em>
&lt;legend&gt;Specific Data for This Task&lt;/legend&gt;
Country: &lt;select data="COUNTRY" class="dataOut dataIn"&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;US&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;China&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;Canada&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/select&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
State: &lt;input type="text" data="STATE" class="dataOut dataIn"/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Use Postal Code: &lt;input type='checkbox' data="USE_POSTAL_CODE" class="dataOut dataIn"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
</font>
&#35;{MDW.TASK_COMMON_BUTTONS}        <em>&lt;!-- task action buttons --&gt;</em>

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>The place holder <code>MDW.TASK_COMMON_DATA</code>
displays most of the common task instance data such as task status, assignee,
create date, due date, etc, covered above. The generated code uses a fieldset tag.
The fieldset in blue color is for task specific data. The only requirement
for this section is that the id of the fieldset
must be set to <code>ajax_update</code>, as some of the standard buttons
update the data in this section using the id.
The place holder <code>MDW.TASK_COMMON_BUTTONS</code> generates
the common task action buttons for claiming, completing tasks, etc.
The generated code also uses a fieldset tag.
It is common that the application would like to customize the task
action buttons. The following is a sample of customized button 
generation, which should replace this place holder.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;fieldset&gt;
&lt;legend&gt;Actions&lt;/legend&gt;
&#35;if META.TaskStatus=="Assigned" and META.TaskAssignStatus=="self"
&lt;input type="button" value="Complete (FOO)" onclick="task_action('FOO')"/&gt;
&lt;input type="button" value="Save" onclick="task_action('Save')"/&gt;
&lt;input type="button" value="Abort" onclick="task_action('Abort')"/&gt;
&lt;input type="button" value="Cancel" onclick="task_action('Cancel')"/&gt;
&lt;input type="button" value="Release" onclick="task_action('Release')"/&gt;
&lt;input type="button" value="Forward" onclick="task_action('Forward')"/&gt;
&#35;end
&#35;if META.TaskStatus=="Assigned" and META.TaskAssignStatus!="self"
&lt;input type="button" value="Crab It" onclick="task_action('Claim')"/&gt;
&#35;end
&#35;if META.TaskStatus=="Open"
&lt;input type="button" value="Claim" onclick="task_action('Claim')"/&gt;
&lt;input type="button" value="Assign" onclick="task_action('Assign')"/&gt;
&#35;end
&#35;if META.TaskStatus!="Open" and META.TaskStatus!="Assigned"
No action can be performed as the task is already closed.
&#35;end
&lt;/fieldset&gt;
</pre>

The HTML page must be created in the designer which will store the page as resources in the RULE_SET
table. The drop down list for form names in the attribute page of the general manual task
activity should list all html pages in the database in addition to forms.
<p>
There are a lot of features supported by MDW HTML pages.
A much more thorough documentation along with working sample code
can be found at the link <code>http://<var>host</var>:<var>port</var>/<var>MDWTaskManagerWeb</var>/MDWHTTPListener/form?name=html:htmlDocAndSample</code>
when you have an MDW-based application server is running.
In the following we will refer to this documentation page as <em>on-line document</em>.
</p>

<h2>Control - Task Actions</h2>
With the exception of a small set of predefined functions that are directly implemented
in JavaScript and/or the task manager, general task actions (called <em>custom
task actions</em>) are implemented in the engine
using Java classes that implements the interface <code>com.centurylink.mdw.common.utilities.form.FormAction</code>,
which are also invoked through JavaScript functions.
The following table lists all JavaScript functions that can be associated with a button press
or menu item selection.
<table border='1'>
<tr><th>Syntax</th><th>Semantics</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>dialog_open(<var>dialog_id</var>)</code></td>
    <td>Open a dialog. See on-line document for its usage.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>dialog_ok(<var>dialog_id</var>)</code></td>
    <td>Close a dialog and commit the changes in the dialog to the main window.
     This is client-side only function. See on-line document for its usage.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>dialog_cancel(<var>dialog_id</var>)</code></td>
    <td>Close a dialog and discard changes made in the dialog.
     This is client-side only function. See on-line document for its usage.</td></tr>

    When <code>idToRefresh</code> is <code>'CLIENT'</code>, it performs refresh on the client side only;
    when <code>idToRefresh</code> specifies an ID of a HTML element, it uses Ajax to repaint only
    that element and all its descendants;
    and when <code>idToRefresh</code> is <code>'SERVER'</code>, it goes to the server and repaint the entire page.

<h3>Standard in-flow task actions</h3>
You can call the JavaScript function <code>task_action(taskAction)</code>
for standard in-flow task actions specified as the argument, which include:
<ul>
  <li><code>'Complete'</code>: complete the task and send null completion code to the engine</li>
  <li><code>'Assign'</code>: assign the task to an authorized user, all authorized users
  						are listed in a dropdown menu.</li>
  <li><code>'Forward'</code>: this does exactly the same thing as 'Assign', except
  			'Assign' is supposed to be used when the task status is Open, and 'Forward'
  			is to be used when the task is assigned to the current user.</li>
  <li><code>'Cancel'</code>: cancel the task instance. The activity instance in the process will
  			be cancelled as well, and transitions will be made assuming the completion code is null.</li>
  <li><code>'Abort'</code>: cancel the task and abort the process associated with the task. 
  			The process instance will be cancelled, after invoking cancellation handler if one is 
  			defined.</li>
  <li><code>'Claim'</code>: claim the task to work on. This can be used when the task status is open, or assigned
  			to someone else</li>
  <li><code>'Release'</code>: release the task which is currently assigned. Changes made to data will be discarded.</li>
  <li><code>'Save'</code>: save changes made to the task data. The task status will remain assigned.</li>
  <li>Any other action:
  			For any other action, complete the task and send the specified action as completion code to the engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we also support the function to forward a task to a different group, which we
will call <em>Transfer</em> to differentiate from forwarding to another user. Because transfer functionality
is typically non-standard (e.g. which groups we allow to transfer to), we do not provide
a default implementation, and you can use built-in task action
 <code>perform_action(@ASSIGN_TASK?action=Forward&amp;prompt_input=<var>new_task_name</var>)</code>, which
 will be explained later.</p>

<h3>Custom task actions</h3>
<p>You will invoke JavaScript function <code>perform_action(action, showBusy)</code>.
The first argument is an action specification, which is a java class name followed by optional arguments
in URL-like syntax (name-value pairs separated by ampersands following a question mark).
an example is as follows:</p>
<pre>
   com.qwest.esowf.formaction.TransportTaskForm?subaction=AddHop&amp;hopid=5
</pre>
<p>Custom actions are implemented as Java classes and are invoked synchronously.
We will cover later on how to write custom server actions.</p>

<h3>Calling custom task actions using Ajax</h3>
The server actions can also be invoked through Ajax, using JavaScript method <code>ajax_action(action, idToUpdate)</code>.
The main difference is that <code>perform_action</code> will load a whole page after completion,
whereas <code>ajax_action</code> will only update the specified portion of the page (without loading a new page).

<h3>Asynchronous custom task actions</h3>
<p>
Both <code>perform_action</code> and <code>ajax_action</code> wait for server to respond with
the next page (even though the latter only updates portion of the page, it still waits for server response).
This implies that if the server action takes a long time, the server thread serving the web page must
be held for the entire period, thereby potentially reducing the scalability. An alternative 
approach is <em>asynchronous task actions</em>, where the server thread returns an intermediate page
immediately, not waiting for the actual response to come back, and the client is polling the server
for the actual response. In this design, except the browser itself which is polling, all down stream
actions can be implemented asynchronously.</p>
<p>
The asynchronous task action is achieved by the method <code>ajax_action_async(action, idToUpdate,
 timeout_sec, checkInterval, callback)</code>. The parameters in addition to those common
 to <code>ajax_aciton</code> are explained below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><var>timeout_sec</var>: the number of seconds the browser times out (no longer polling).</li>
  <li><var>checkInterval</var>: the number of seconds between two polls</li>
  <li><var>callback</var>: an optional argument specifying a call back function that takes
  		a single boolean argument, such as <code>function(success){ alert(success}; }</code>.
  		If the callback is suppied, it will be invoked when the response is obtained successfully,
  		when the polling times out, or when the user cancels the waiting. The argument <var>success</var>
  		is passed in <code>true</code> in the first case and <code>false</code> in the other two.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Custom Task Actions Implementation</h2>
Custom task actions are implemented as Java classes
that implements the interface <code>com.centurylink.mdw.listener.formaction.FormAction</code>.
There is only one method to implement:
<pre>
   public String handleAction(FormDataDocument datadoc,Map&lt;String, String&gt; params, EJBContext ejb)
</pre>
The first argument is the data document submitted by the task manager, with 
the following items reset: <code>META.ACTION</code> and <code>ERROR</code>.
The second argument contains the following information:
<ol>
  <li>Listener specific parameters, such as <code>CorrelationID</code> for JMS listeners
      and <code>Protocol</code> for all listeners.</li>
  <li>Parameters from the external event handler specifications (none for out-of-box FORMDATA event handler 
      specification)</li>
  <li><code>ACTION</code> which is the submitted action that was in <code>META.ACTION</code>, as well as
  	  parsed arguments of the action.</li>
  <li>All meta entries in the form data document itself.</li>
</ol>
If a parameter appears in more than one place, the later ones will overwrite the earlier ones. 
The method should return the string form of a form data document to be sent back to the 
task manager and browser.
The followings list some common how-to-dos:
<ul>
   <li>Add an error message to be popped up: you can use <code>datadoc.addError(<var>error-message</var>)</code>.
   		Note that if you ever add an error message, any changes to the data document other than errors
   		will be ignored by the task manager and will not be sent to the client (browser).</li>
   <li>Go to a different form: use <code>datadoc.setAttribute(FormDataDocument.ATTR_FORM,<var>new-form-name</var>)</code>.</li>
   <li>Set up some special actions after returning to task manager: you can set <code>META.ACTION</code>.
   		The followings are supported entries:
   		<ul>
   		  <li><code>@PROMPT</code>: show an information dialog, whose content is taken from <code>META.PROMPT</code>.
   		  	This can indeed be done by just setting <code>META.PROMPT</code> alone.
   		  	</li>
   		  <li><code>@DIALOG?uniqueid=<var>dialog-id</var></code>: open a dialog, which must be already
   		  		defined in the specified window. 
   		  		</li>
   		  <li><code>@WINDOW?formName=<var>form-name</var></code>: open a window.
  				</li>
   		  <li><code>@COMPLETE_TASK</code>: complete the current task (will not inform engine again)</li>
   		  <li><code>@LOGOFF</code>: log off the session. Typically you will also specify
   		  		a log-off page through setting a form name mentioned above.
   		  		After pressing the following test button, any further call to the server
   		  		will get session expired error message.
  			</li>
   		</ul>
	  </li>
</ul>
<p>
For asynchronous custom task actions, they are typically implemented as follows:
<ul>
  <li>The form action class starts an (asynchronous) process to serve the request,
      and returns immediately as an acknowlegement to the task manager.</li>
  <li>The process will eventually send the actual response to the task manager,
      typically by executing the activity <code>SendResponseToTask</code>.
      </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Multiple Step Tasks and Error Handling</h2>

For manual tasks that require multiple steps (pages or screens), the additional
steps can be specified using this activity. The way to link the two (or more)
activities to the same task instance is by populating ID attribute of the
form data document to be <code>TaskInstance:<var>task_instance_id</var></code>
for all steps except the initial one (which creates the task instance
and populates this field automatically).
<p>
For subsequent steps, you only need to specify the following attributes:

<ul>
  <li>Form Name. Since each page often uses different presentation, so a form name
      must be specified for each additional page.</li>
  <li>Form Data Document Variable. This instructs the activity where to get the form data. Like
      <code>FormDataDocumentManualTaskActivity</code>, you can obtain the data through overriding
      the method <code>createFormData</code> instead.</li>
  <li>Wait for Task. For multiple step tasks, all steps except the last need
      to have this attribute set to true, as the activity must wait for
      call backs from the task. For the very last step (user completes the task),
      it is optional whether the activity should wait</li>
</ul>

If the task manager calls back to the engine and the process finds errors and need
to re-display the same page with optionally additional error messages, the process
can add error messages to the data document (by using the method 
<code>FormDataDocument.addError()</code>) and make an "ERROR" transition back to
the same task activity (AdditionalPageActivity as well as FormDataDocumentManualTaskActivity -
in case of the latter, it behaves just like an AdditionalPageActivity in this case,
namely without creating another task instance).
