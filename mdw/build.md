## Publishing an mdw6 build

1 - Edit gradle.properties to set the new build numbers.
    - mdwVersion
    
2 - Run Gradle task updateMdwVerInFiles to update these files: 
  - mdw-workflow/.settings/com.centurylink.mdw.plugin.xml
  - mdw-hub/package.json
  - mdw-hub/bower.json
  - RestApiDefinition.java
  - **/.mdw/package.json

3 - Clean Tag (Formal builds only)
  - Delete SNAPSHOT release and tags
      - git pull
      - git tag -d 6.0.xx-SNAPSHOT 
      - Delete the Draft of SNAPSHOT from GitHub:
        https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/releases
      - git push origin --tags
        
4 - Git pull and Commit and push all the above changes to Git.
  - Travis CI will run the build, tests and publish to maven-central or sonatype.
  - Compilation or testing errors will prevent the build from being published.

5 - After success, verify release artifacts are published to Maven Central (https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories)
  - Formal build:       http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/centurylink/mdw/ (10 min)
  - SNAPHOT:            https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/centurylink/mdw/ 
  - Assets:             http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/centurylink/mdw/assets/tests-workflow/  (10 min)
  - SNAPSHOT Assets:             https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/centurylink/mdw/assets/tests-workflow/
  - Buildpack:          https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-buildpack/tree/master/resources/mdw
  - Internal buildpack: https://ne1itcprhas62.ne1.savvis.net/PCF_Buildpacks_PUB_DEV/mdw-buildpack/tree/master/resources/mdw

6 - Run task 1,2 & 4 and commit the files right away for the post-release snapshot (to prevent another commit from auto-publishing).

7 - (Formal builds only) On GitHub:
  - Create a milestone marker for the next build. (https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw/milestones/new)
  - Assign any un-delivered issues and pull request for current build's milestone to the next build's milestone.
  - Close this build's milestone in GitHub.
