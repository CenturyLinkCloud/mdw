### MDW Documentation
  - https://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/

### Core Developer Setup
1. Prerequisites
   - Eclipse Oxygen for JavaEE Developers:                              
     http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/
   - MDW Designer Plugin:
     https://centurylinkcloud.github.io/mdw/docs/getting-started/install-designer/
   - Tomcat 8/8.5:                                  
     http://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi
   - Postman:                                            
     https://www.getpostman.com/apps

2. Get the Source Code
   - Command-line Git:  
     `git clone https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw.git mdw6`
   - Then in Eclipse:  
     Import the projects into your Eclipse workspace:  
     File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace

3. Set up npm (One-time step)
   - Install NodeJS:                                                                     
     https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
   - Open a command prompt in the mdw-hub project directory
     ```
     npm install
     ```
4a. Build in IntelliJ IDEA
   - Run IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
   - Select Open Project and browse to mdw/mdw
   - In the Gradle tool window, execute the buildDev task.

4b. Build in Eclipse
   - Window > Show View > Other > Gradle  > Gradle Tasks.
   - Expand the mdw project, click View Menu > Show All Tasks, then expand `other` and double-click the `buildDev` task (on Mac it may be necessary to run Gradle from the command line).
   - Refresh all projects in Eclipse and (ctrl-b) to build (or let autobuild do it).  Incremental builds can be performed this way and do not require a Gradle build.

5. Use [Embedded DB](/mdw-workflow/assets/com/centurylink/mdw/db/readme.md) or set up an external MySQL database as described in [this readme](/mdw/database/mysql/readme.txt)

6. Edit configuration files to suit local environment:
   - mdw/config/mdw.yaml (locally, use absolute paths for mdw.asset.location and mdw.git.local.path)
   - mdw/config/access.yaml (set devUser to yourself)
   - mdw/config/seed_users.json
   - (On Linux or Mac): Copy mdw-common/src/META-INF/mdw/spring/application-context.xml to mdw/config/spring/application-context.xml, and edit so that ActiveMQ dataDirectory points to a writeable location.

7a. Run Spring Boot Jar in IntelliJ IDEA
   - From the IntelliJ menu select Run > Edit Configurations.
   - Click **+** > Jar Application.
   - For Path to Jar, browse to mdw/deploy/app/mdw-boot-6.1.XX-SNAPSHOT.jar
   - VM Options: -Dmdw.runtime.env=dev -Dmdw.config.location=mdw/config
   - Save the configuration and type ctrl-alt-R to run/debug MDW.

7b. Run on Tomcat in Eclipse
   - In Eclipse Servers view, right-click and select New > Server  
     **Important**: Select the Apache > Tomcat 8/8.5 (MDW) runtime
     and make sure you have a jdk 1.8 (vs jre) selected for the runtime.
   - Select the mdw-hub module in the Add/Remove wizard page
   - Double-click on the server and set the startup timeout to something large (like 3600s)
   - Under MDW Server Options set the following Java Options (appropriate for your workspace):
     ```    
     -Dmdw.runtime.env=dev  
     -Dmdw.config.location=c:/workspaces/mdw/mdw/config
     -Xms512m -Xmx1024m
     ```
   - Right-click on the server and select Debug to start it up (this should automatically publish mdw-hub)
   - (On Linux and Mac): Right-click on the mdw-hub project in Eclipse and manually add the 'web' folder to the root of the Deployment Assembly: Properties > Deployment Assembly.  If initially mdw-hub publishing is incomplete (missing index.html, etc):
     - On the file system under mdw-hub/deploy, delete the directories webapps/mdw and work/Catalina/localhost/mdw.
	 - In Eclipse Servers view, right-click on your server and select Clean from the menu.
   - Check MDWHub access:                                                
     http://localhost:8080/mdw

9. Run the Tests
   - Access the autotest page in MDWHub:
     http://localhost:8080/mdw/#/tests
   - Use the Settings button to enable Stubbing and increase Threads to 10
   - Select all test cases, and execute

### Designer Development
   - https://github.com/CenturyLinkCloud/mdw-designer/blob/master/README.md

### Documentation
1. Source
   - Documentation is in the docs directory of the master branch on GitHub
   - **Important:** When editing .md files in IntelliJ, to preserve trailing whitespace characters, install the Markdown plugin:
     - https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7793-markdown-support
     Do not commit changes to markdown files that remove trailing whitespace.
2. Local GitHub Pages
   - To test doc access before pushing, and to make changes to default layouts and styles, you can build through [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/) locally.
   - Install Ruby 2.3.3 or higher and add its bin directory to your PATH.
   - Install Bundler:
     ```
     gem install bundler
     ```
   - Download the CURL CA Certs from http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem and save in your Ruby installation directory.
   - Set environment variable SSL_CERT_FILE to point to this this cacert.pem file location.
   - Install Ruby DevKit: https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit
   - Install Jekyll and all its dependencies (in the docs directory):
     ```
     bundle install
     ```
   - Build GitHub pages site locally (in the docs directory):
     ```
     bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --watch --baseurl ''
     ```
   - Access locally in your browser:
     http://127.0.0.1:4000/
